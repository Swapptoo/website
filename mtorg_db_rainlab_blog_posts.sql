With the proper tools and the proper understanding of the information gathered marketers and site owners can improve their processes. But all this collecting and gathering is meaningless without understanding how to make the data useful.  

    
#### What does useful data look like?
 Useful data can take many forms. The quickest and easiest way to assess the value of your information is how it affects your sales and your marketing process. Useful information does not merely overwhelm you with statistics and markers and information about each visitor. Useful information provides you with tools and forecasts which refine and improve your business and thus increase revenue, customers, or whatever your particular sales goals might be.  

 
#### How does data become useful?
 Data becomes useful to your business when it’s been filtered, refined, and used to provide forecasts. Marketing automation tools must compile this data and provide these results. Unfortunately too many marketing automation tools make complex situations even more complex by requiring incredibly detailed and intricate setup. This involves a very large investment of time by employees who have limited time and other job responsibilities as well.  

 This challenge of unique business situations and advanced knowledge for setup and configuration is an often crippling factor for most businesses. Small businesses especially have limited resources and people to undertake this time intensive process.

 "Well, where does it go?"  
 "That does not seem safe. And whatever happened to privacy?"  

 The realization that the activities one performs in the solitude of their home or office are actually public, is somehow a shock to many individuals. This is an all too common response for many consumers, especially those working outside of a technical industry. It is easy to feel distant and anonymous behind the shield of the computer screen. One no longer needs to interact on a face-to-face level in order to make purchases or schedule services, but this does not mean that you are in a private space. Many are scared of the idea that they are somehow being snooped on and that utilizing public information is an invasion of privacy.  

    
### Global Network
 The internet is a global network, a shared public space where anyone can see anyone, if you choose to look. Online activity is interpreted into motivational values and in essence, a digital interpretation of consumer body language. Online consumers explore the expanse of goods, services and investments by traversing the spectrum of commerce websites. In a retail situation, real time feedback has always been the marketer’s best analysis, that is, with the proper tools and insight to turn it into sales. The A/B testing of item placement, color, interact-ability , and so on, is clear and instantaneous. So how does an online merchant or marketer view this feedback or “body language”?  

 
#### Real Life Example
 Picture this scenario. A shopper stands in a store and browses the items on display. Anyone who has ever worked in face to face sales knows what their gestures suggest about their acceptance or disapproval of that product. The sales person watches the customer pickup, touch, feel, and examine the product to see if this meets their requirements. The question is, what factors are at play in the consumer’s decision making and how does one gauge that process online?  

 In short, the first often unconscious, question the observer asks is “do I need this”, or does this at least catch my attention, a strategy often implemented by corporations selling mundane products. However, upon seeing the prospective client react to their experience of interaction with their potential acquisition, the retailer is able to change and adapt to the customer’s desired experience and an ever fluctuating market. This merchant-consumer relationship is what drives business and creates satisfied customers. So how does one apply these concepts to an online business?  

 
### Maintain Relationship Integrity
 The most effective tools for maintaining the integrity of this relationship are those which collate information on web activity into consumer profiles. Whether the profile is used for lead tracking, nurturing, automation, or even individual sales, understanding your customer is always the first step to getting your product in their hands.  

 Marketing automation has brought real-time feedback into the online market. Based on the profile, associated values for different actions, and campaigns built to reach the customers who might truly want your product, the A/B testing of the shopkeeper’s careful observation has come back into play. Whether a sale is face-to-face or digital, it is always the same on some level. Each party has something that the other wants, and the exchange of goods is an active agreement to stand behind your product or service with pride.  

 
### People Matter
 The internet may be dehumanizing and disconnected, but the human brain has not changed, nor has its expectations of the consumer relationship. We all understand that in order to grow, improve and succeed, one must continuously adapt and test new strategies. Gauge the customer’s response, interact with them on a personal or emotional level, and most importantly, meet them where they are in their lives (interest, need vs. want, price, purpose, energy level, etc.) Always engage, always improve, and always remember that no matter how different technology makes the world seem, people are the heart of a business, and that will never change.

Promising enormous growth rates and ROI, marketing automation platforms sell a service that truly works.

No one can argue that an internal investment of time and utilization of the proper automation software can yield tremendous results, but are you going about it the right way? When choosing an option for your business, it is necessary to consider not only the glimmering promise of sales and revenue growth, but also the inevitable failings and drawbacks of this lucrative industry.



## 1. You’re paying too much.

If you are using marketing automation services, how much are you paying?

What percentage of your departmental budget consists of marketing automation platforms or an external service managing you clients?

The answers to these two questions are likely much higher than you would think. Already a billion dollar industry, marketing automation platforms (like Hubspot, Eloqua, and Marketo) continue to find new ways to coax clients into utilizing additional services with separate pricing tiers and subsequent service caps. Most small businesses and startups cannot afford to pay thousands of dollars every month for a single service.

Does the service you receive match the extreme rates you are paying? It is not secret that marketing automation is expensive, but what are the consequences of the overpriced service? For one thing, it means that only highly developed, revenue generating companies have access to the powerful growth potential of the software, and is the service really worth the cost for those who can afford to pay?

## 2. No Access to **your** data

Marketing automation platforms use big data for “Big” results, but without the right effort and access on the user end, results are unlikely to be of any real value. Marketing automation platforms are not only gladly taking your money, but they also get to choose what data you can access. Unfortunately, this means that all potential leads, consumer profiles and traffic data is filtered through your platform, they choose what percentage to give you as a report. As a result, you are at left at the far end of the data stream to use what you are given as opposed to what is yours. Why not allow access to it all, if you so choose? This brings us to the next point, that in addition to only having a limited amount of data access, you do not truly have any engagement with the powerful software itself.

## 3. Service Only, Not Software.

Marketing automation services are incredibly valuable to the growth of company. According to a survey published by Carlos Hidalgo of the Annuitas Group,

> Businesses who use marketing automation to nurture prospects experience a 451% increase in qualified leads.

In addition to staggering growth potential, the survey showed an increase in revenue of 417%. These statics imply that it will not be a matter of if businesses adopt, but when? Let’s explore what you are getting by way of service.

A strange dynamic exists between clients and providers, since you the client rarely engage with the software. You only receive the reports, leads, and data that is given to you in exchange for thousands per month. With the proper investment of time and an easy to use platform, anyone could utilize the strength of concept and achieve new growth potential. Currently, however, marketing automation users do not have access to the necessary software, and the service leaves much to be desired.

## 4. If You Find A Problem, Too Bad.

When a user experiences any sort of bugs, complications, or limitations in the program, they will have to wait until the next release and update. This drawback of closed proprietary services is common, but somehow almost expected. When a user runs into a problem with the program, they will have to wait until the platform developers address, fix, test and schedule an update release. When did this become the standard response upon encountering errors? What about the possibility of adding features and customizing the software for your purposes? Forget about it!

If you are a developer and coding is your thing, it does not matter that you posses the skills to fix and customize because you will never see that closed software.

## 5. User/Lead Caps

It is not enough that marketing automation platforms charge you a fortune, decide what data you receive, withhold access to the software, and make it impossible to address errors or add features, but they even add service caps in a multi-tiered service plan. Depending on the size of your company and what product or services you offer, some may not need to generate thousands of leads. Accordingly, each service plan includes a maximum number of leads. As your business grows and you find out that you can now handle all of these leads, providers will re-categorize and reprice your account to squeeze even more of your marketing budget out of you. All the while, you still are only receiving the reduced, chosen leads for which you pay.

When did these problems become so commonplace? I guess it is true that the one with the money and the software makes the rules. It takes a great deal of nerve and arrogance to demand the sky-high service rates of marketing automation providers and still limit your uses, access, experience and growth. So why has no one done anything about this dissonant dynamic?

## There is Hope

Hope has arrived to an industry dominated by elitist proprietary services. While executives from Eloqua, Pardot, Marketo and HubSpot are laughing all the way the bank, changes are happening and the ground is shifting beneath their feet. Open source activists have penetrated into many sectors of the tech industry, and now it has reached the explosive marketing automation sector. What this means, is that the absurdly wealth executives who have gotten away with it so far, are about to learn what universal access to powerful marketing automation software will do to their company. Unless the clients are too wealthy to care about what they spend and too lazy to care about the quality of service, this open alternative will be utilized and will be developed.

## A Bright Future

It is clear that the market is flush with opportunity and that marketing automation will continue to play an ever more vital role in growing businesses and organizations. The power of the concept is immense, the results are remarkable, and the service has left much to be desired. Software giants will not and cannot continue to do as they please while getting rich on your revenue. So choose wisely and remember what faults to look out for in a marketing automation service provider. Look to open source solutions like Mautic, a nonprofit development community with the only open source marketing automation software on the market. Now that the faults of the current system are clear and the solution seems to lie in open source transparency, more software and services will continue to pour from this powerful alternative.', '<a href="https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/">Marketing automation</a> is a young and vivacious sector of an immensely beneficial and lucrative industry.

Another term often spoken in the same breath is that of transparency, but** transparency does not equal open source**.

It is a **commitment to** **total clarity**, in business practice, structure, finance, and design, something many companies would be horrified to consider. So what are the differences and how do we discuss these two concepts with consideration for their distinct implications?    
## Open Source 
 Open source refers primarily to the availability of **original coding** to be **accessed,** **modified**, and **repurposed**. Software developers utilize volumes of open source code to create new programs with greater efficiency and new complexities. Access to code is becoming a standard in the development world. It is a give-and-take relationship where access to open frameworks leads to rapid development and quicker releases of new and updated software.   According to Rachael King of The Wall Street Journal, the largest companies with hordes of developers are utilizing open source to make new products in a much shorter timeframe. This list includes the likes of *Facebook, Google, GE, Sears, Chevron, MasterCard, and Dell*, with hundreds more contributing to the **shared development of new technology**. Let’s not forget about the impact of open CMS companies like *Joomla, WordPress, and Drupal,* changing the pace and accessibility of web development. The list of those who have not engaged in the open source process is much shorter than the inverse, with the primary holdout being the federal government. Why would the US government choose not to engage in openness, and how does all of this relate to *organizational transparency*?   
## Transparency
 Open source is certainly an **aspect of transparency**, but only as one minor demonstration of the greater ideal that transparency represents. Benefits of transparency include **fostering trust** with your customers and community, setting an example of **faultless business practice**, sharing your company’s innovation for the advancement of society and technology, and allowing **creative problem solving** out in the open.    In an age of corporate monopolies, government bailouts, insider trading, and semi-legal contracts, where corporate lobbyists can but the right to screw you, it is hard to imagine that the largest corporations would ever adopt transparency as the standard. Their solution is to engage in open source sharing of code under the well crafted PR statements about *"seeking transparency"*. If one is to see through the blatant ploy of appeasement, we must first differentiate the two commonly interchanged concepts.    Gerry Adams, president of the Irish Sinn Féin party, said *“one man''s transparency is another’s humiliation"*. When did the public become content to have industry strongholds operate **behind closed doors** and with so much to hide? If a business or organization has that amount of sensitive information, the question becomes *“who is getting screwed here and what exactly are they hiding"*? More than likely it is the everyday consumer, being charged several hundred percent of production cost, never gaining access to promised resources and services supported by millions or billions of investment dollars from venture capitalists and governmental organizations. Who knows, really? And that is the point.   Not all businesses choose to take this route, however. Every day, more organizations are demonstrating **complete transparency** in business, not simply open sourcing their software development, but going as far as to publish their **spending, earnings and projects**. One perfect example of this new standard for transparency is that of the social media management and automation company [Buffer](https://bufferapp.com/). They have chosen to make all aspects of their business practice fully open and you can read every bit of it on their blog [https://open.bufferapp.com](https://open.bufferapp.com). Check it out.    Transparency is the standard of altruistic organizations and it is just **good business**. No one is saying that transparency means the destruction of capitalism, but what should we expect from the largest companies and from our government? We should never have to demand a shift toward openness or set an example of what it means to operate a business **in broad daylight**. If we cannot expect our government to allow its citizens to know how it operates, then we are passively enabling wrong doing and marginalized success at the expense of all.    Open source is a beautiful thing and it has transformed how businesses work, develop, and operate. However, as we have seen, open source is merely an aspect of the larger concept and ideal that is Transparency. The two are **not interchangeable**, but certainly **should go together**. More companies are jumping on the transparency train and a few are setting a new standard for what it means to demonstrate the concept.    *All who believe in equality, should also strive for transparency, for one cannot exist without the other. *', '<div>Open Source is a hot topic and the idea has reach almost every sector, not only as a concept but also in practice.

Leaving the last year behind gives us the chance to reflect on our choices, measure our gains, cut our losses and begin anew! Maybe you had a great year full of positive change and you would like to see more of it. Perhaps like many, however, you want this year to be different, better, even stronger than the last. If you have hope for a better year, keep it, nurture it, and plan it to the last detail before the spirit of renewal and all of its momentum slips away!      
#### Step One: Know Yourself
 You have resolved to grow this year, but knowing what you want is only half the battle. Change comes from within and your mind is the battlefield. When you know what it is that you need to change, you must set goals and orient yourself to a place of success. Once you have your mind in alignment with your goals, the outcome depends on careful planning, in your organization, and commitment. So let''s prepare ourselves for this year’s success, shall we?   
#### Success Begins Within
 
> Albert Einstein once said, “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”
 Many of history''s greatest minds have expressed this fact with great insight and articulation. The greater truth that one can find is in the power of perception, one’s personal construction and reaction to the world around them. Your own personal motivation to initiate internal change, along with careful planning for success, gives the courage and tenacity required to make lasting change.   You are not your business, but your business is part of you and if it is to change, it must begin in you. Read, create, discuss, and resolve to change your attitude. First identify your mental barriers to daily success. Whether it comes in the form of distractions, feeling easily defeated, living with imbalance and stress, or simply not feeling motivated, all of these things will hinder you from envisioning your success. Without mental clarity it is difficult to know exactly where you want to be or how to get there. It is never easy to initiate perceptual changes because the mind seeks consistency and the world is full of surprises that bring failure and difficulty to our lives. *The question is not whether it is difficult, but how strongly do you want to make a change, how far are you willing to go to make your dreams into reality?* If you have identified your inhibitors, envisioned your success and committed yourself to the effort, then you are ready to begin the next step towards growth; setting your goals.   
#### Set Goals
 It is not terribly difficult to imagine yourself in a better place than where you are, but imagination alone does little to ensure your arrival to that unique place of success. If you have tried to make things better and it simply will not stick, then you must do it differently. Performing the same tasks time and time again, but expecting a different result is insanity. In your life, you must make conscious decisions and take proper steps to think differently, perform differently, and choose differently then you have done previously. Did that choice led to your desired results previously? If not, choose differently, choose wisely, and be courageous! If that choice is no better, you have not failed, but gained an answer to the question and additional experience. You are one step closer to success when you cross an attempted strategy off of your list.   Setting goals can be scary and may feel daunting sometimes. Where do I start, and what happens when I screw up? Remember, screwing things up is inevitable, if you don’t, life will help, but your progress does not have to stop at your mistake. Cross it off the list and ask your original question. What is the problem, and what options do I have to solve it? Quite possibly, you will find a better choice than the first time and your “wrong" decision will give you a better perspective.   When setting goals for overcoming mental barriers, start small with simple changes. If you’ve made a list of barriers, identify the one you think is most attainable and tackle it head-on, but with your own personal recipe for success. 
#### 3 Things For Successful Decision-Making
 Write down these three things to help you plan for successful decision-making  

 
 2. What was the problem or need that warranted the decision? 4. What options do you have to solve or fix the problem? 6. What will you choose, the next time you are faced with this or a similar problem? 
 When the problem reappears, you will have thought about your experience, considered your options and have a plan for successfully overcoming the mental obstacles that once stood in your way. You will find strength in your new ability and your success will give you courage to face every challenge with wisdom and purpose.   
#### Organize your goals and use your plan
 While working on mental barriers it is good to keep long-term goals in mind and maintain the perspective of your overall orientation. Remember the future you imagined, the perfect place where you know you need to be? Describe it, write about it, sing about it if that helps! What does it feel like? Where do you think you will be? Simply describing your future self helps to visualize who you will be and direct your choices toward the realization of your vision. The most important questions for creating your long term goals are “what will each day look like and what habits will the more successful version of yourself possess”? Identify three to five habits that you think your future self will need, and start practicing. Each day, you must live like the person you want to become, or you are destined to relive the same day, the same past, and the same mistakes.   If you agree that 2015 has the potential to be a better year, then join me in actively making it the truth. Do not be afraid to try new things, learn from your mistakes, create a plan to deal with problems more effectively, ask for help when you need it, seek out creative solutions to keep yourself inspired, start small, and overcome barriers with all of the skills you already possess.   Here’s to you and to your year of growth!', '<div>The new year has arrived and with it comes new opportunity!

So let''s prepare ourselves for this year’s success, shall we?</div> <div> </div> <h4>Success Begins Within</h4> <blockquote>Albert Einstein once said, “The world as we have created it is a process of our thinking. It cannot be changed without changing our thinking.”</blockquote> <div>Many of history''s greatest minds have expressed this fact with great insight and articulation. The greater truth that one can find is in the power of perception, one’s personal construction and reaction to the world around them. Your own personal motivation to initiate internal change, along with careful planning for success, gives the courage and tenacity required to make lasting change.</div> <div> </div> <div>You are not your business, but your business is part of you and if it is to change, it must begin in you. Read, create, discuss, and resolve to change your attitude. First identify your mental barriers to daily success. Whether it comes in the form of distractions, feeling easily defeated, living with imbalance and stress, or simply not feeling motivated, all of these things will hinder you from envisioning your success. Without mental clarity it is difficult to know exactly where you want to be or how to get there. It is never easy to initiate perceptual changes because the mind seeks consistency and the world is full of surprises that bring failure and difficulty to our lives. <em>The question is not whether it is difficult, but how strongly do you want to make a change, how far are you willing to go to make your dreams into reality?</em> If you have identified your inhibitors, envisioned your success and committed yourself to the effort, then you are ready to begin the next step towards growth; setting your goals.</div> <div> </div> <h4>Set Goals</h4> <div>It is not terribly difficult to imagine yourself in a better place than where you are, but imagination alone does little to ensure your arrival to that unique place of success. If you have tried to make things better and it simply will not stick, then you must do it differently. Performing the same tasks time and time again, but expecting a different result is insanity. In your life, you must make conscious decisions and take proper steps to think differently, perform differently, and choose differently then you have done previously. Did that choice led to your desired results previously? If not, choose differently, choose wisely, and be courageous! If that choice is no better, you have not failed, but gained an answer to the question and additional experience. You are one step closer to success when you cross an attempted strategy off of your list.</div> <div> </div> <div>Setting goals can be scary and may feel daunting sometimes. Where do I start, and what happens when I screw up? Remember, screwing things up is inevitable, if you don’t, life will help, but your progress does not have to stop at your mistake. Cross it off the list and ask your original question. What is the problem, and what options do I have to solve it? Quite possibly, you will find a better choice than the first time and your “wrong" decision will give you a better perspective.</div> <div> </div> <div>When setting goals for overcoming mental barriers, start small with simple changes. If you’ve made a list of barriers, identify the one you think is most attainable and tackle it head-on, but with your own personal recipe for success.</div> <h4>3 Things For Successful Decision-Making</h4> <p>Write down these three things to help you plan for successful decision-making</p> <ol> <li>What was the problem or need that warranted the decision?</li> <li>What options do you have to solve or fix the problem?</li> <li>What will you choose, the next time you are faced with this or a similar problem?</li> </ol> <div>When the problem reappears, you will have thought about your experience, considered your options and have a plan for successfully overcoming the mental obstacles that once stood in your way. You will find strength in your new ability and your success will give you courage to face every challenge with wisdom and purpose.</div> <div> </div> <h4>Organize your goals and use your plan</h4> <div>While working on mental barriers it is good to keep long-term goals in mind and maintain the perspective of your overall orientation. Remember the future you imagined, the perfect place where you know you need to be? Describe it, write about it, sing about it if that helps! What does it feel like? Where do you think you will be? Simply describing your future self helps to visualize who you will be and direct your choices toward the realization of your vision. The most important questions for creating your long term goals are “what will each day look like and what habits will the more successful version of yourself possess”? Identify three to five habits that you think your future self will need, and start practicing. Each day, you must live like the person you want to become, or you are destined to relive the same day, the same past, and the same mistakes.</div> <div> </div> <div>If you agree that 2015 has the potential to be a better year, then join me in actively making it the truth. Do not be afraid to try new things, learn from your mistakes, create a plan to deal with problems more effectively, ask for help when you need it, seek out creative solutions to keep yourself inspired, start small, and overcome barriers with all of the skills you already possess.</div> <div> </div> <div>Here’s to you and to your year of growth!</div>', '2015-01-06 12:11:50', 1, '2015-01-06 12:11:50', '2015-01-06 12:11:50');

With so many options it’s difficult to know where to begin, you may need some help when approaching the topic of marketing automation software.

Marketing automation is a powerful process and can produce tremendous gains for your business or organization; that is...when it’s used properly. Any strong marketing campaign requires the same basic principles: objective, strategy, optimization, and implementation. The rudiments of marketing most definitely still apply when utilizing a marketing automation platform, in fact they are even more important when we consider the number of “moving parts” involved in a well-built automation campaign. This leads us to the first step in addressing the learning curve.

### 1. Sharpen Your Marketing Knowledge.

Marketing is a catch-all term for the fields of study, processes of engagement, and creation of interest surrounding the message and image of your products, services, and information. It’s all about getting your message to the right ears and drawing interested customers to your brand over your competitors.

> "You can have brilliant ideas, but if you can''t get them across, your ideas won''t get you anywhere." - Lee Iacocca

Without marketing know-how it is virtually impossible to get the word out, but that doesn’t mean you can’t start marketing with what you do know. You’ve created something you think people will want, but why do they want it? What problems does your product or service solve, and what makes it different or better than the others? If you can answer those questions then you are well on your way to creating killer a marketing plan.

That’s just the beginning of your marketing automation journey, the next step is to **educate yourself**. Find marketing materials, take classes, read books and start simple with your marketing. No one starts off as a guru - we are all learning and growing. What that means to you is that the first step in writing a marketing strategy is to immerse yourself in marketing education, get back to the basics and hone your skills before you implement marketing automation. No marketing campaign, automated or not, can succeed without a thoughtfully written educated strategy.

### 2. Learn The Basics -What Is Marketing Automation & How to "Do" Marketing Automation

Before you can understand how marketing automation fits into your overall marketing plans, you must first understand *[what marketing automation accomplishes](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketing-automation-is-not-scary/)*. Familiarize yourself with the basic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">principles</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">features</span> of automation and put that in context with what you already know about marketing.

Generally, marketing automation is a means of taking the tedious or repetitive tasks, like monitoring leads or sending emails, and automating them. While marketing automation includes many other functions such as: social media tracking, lead behavior tracking, scoring, and 1:1 real-time marketing, it is primarily a smarter, faster, and larger means of reaching specific individuals with an automated series of event triggered communication workflows. Of course, you will learn all about the details and how to make the process more effective, but for now check out marketing automation education materials to learn more.

If you choose to do marketing automation research by visiting service providers sites, don’t let persuasive sales reps push you to make a decision, lay out all of your options for your marketing solutions before you commit any of your budget. Find out what features your business requires and determine what means you will use to achieve their implementation. Whether it is you or an employee who will be focusing on marketing automation, training is the most vital element in your future success.

### 3. Invest in Training

Your real primary investment should be in training and the development of your general marketing skills, alongside marketing automation education. No matter how much money you spend on the capabilities of your marketing automation software, your campaign is only as good as your ability to effectively address every detail of your marketing strategy.

If you do not have the staff to invest in marketing automation training, you might have to find a different course of action. This could mean hiring specialized marketers, increasing your investment in training, or outsourcing your marketing automation to professionals. Regardless of what course you choose, learning the processes is a must.

Whatever your experience in digital marketing, development, or automation, you should make every effort to seek out education through training materials and hands-on development. Some marketing automation providers offer access to learning materials and user group meetings, but only if your pay their exorbitant service rates. Free training resources are available through a nonprofit organization. Mautic is an open source marketing automation community, whose goal is to create community support for marketers, educational resources, and training courses to support their free marketing automation software.

### 4. Build Your First Campaign

Once you’ve learned the basics and gone through some training, it’s time for you to put it all together and [build your first campaign](https://www.mautic.org/blog/campaign-building/). This is an exciting time as you finally get to put your new skills to work. Start with the most basic of your campaign building skills; the key points of your strategy. From there you can further develop each of your campaign points in the framework of marketing automation. Just remember to start simple.


	- Create your campaign strategy
	- Define your elements
	- [Design simple emails, landing pages and forms](https://www.mautic.org/blog/landing-page-love/)
	- [Build your workflow](https://www.mautic.org/blog/drip-campaign-infographic/)
	- Measure your results.


Remember, it’s your first campaign, so it may not be perfect, but it can become much better if you learn from the experience and use the data you get to make your next campaign even better. With this approach, continued learning, and a positive attitude, you are well on your way to becoming a marketing automation professional.

### 5. Analyze Your Campaign Results

The feedback you get from your campaigns is what drives marketing automation progress and leads to long term development and success. The most powerful brands utilize the data from every measure of a campaign’s activity and engagement. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Metrics</span> help marketers to design better sites, landing pages, keywords, email subjects, and any other measurable factor. These metrics allow brands to interpret engagement and consumer behavior in order to consistently improve every detail of their campaign''s design, content, and delivery. The goal is to achieve an optimal level of engagement, by separating your market from the crowd, meeting your leads wherever they are in the customer lifecycle.

As you continue to develop your marketing automation skills, and the ability to interpret your campaign reports, you will find more ways to collect valuable data. One such strategy is that of "split campaigns” or **A/B testing**. By creating two slightly different campaigns and comparing the resulting analytics in defined element fields, marketers can quickly adapt their content or design to their customer’s preference. These unconscious influencers make all the difference with marketing automation, where customer behavior triggers exactly the action you need to drive your message home and to start turning leads into conversions and revenue. Developing your marketing automation skills even further makes you that much more powerful as a marketer and yields stronger growth, so what’s next?

### 6. Specialize & Optimize Your Marketing Automation Skills

Once you have acquired a good understand of the things we have just discussed you will find that each campaign element can be more effectively tested and designed. You may have found what you are already good at, whether it’s [landing page design](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/landing-page/), content writing, customer cycle “[drip flow](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/)” campaigns, or [email campaigns](https://www.mautic.org/blog/email-marketing-level-one/), but what about the elements that could be better?

The key to improving individual campaign elements is in optimization. Whether it’s [SEO](https://blog.kissmetrics.com/keyword-research-part-1/) (the ability to influence the visibility of your website or web page to a search engines parameters or "organic reach") or [Content](http://searchengineland.com/guide/seo/content-search-engine-ranking) Optimization (understanding the way that keywords influence search result, as well as meta-descriptions, alt-tagging, and increased credibility), understanding optimization tactics is crucial to continued development of your campaigns.

One powerful tool that marketing automation provides is the ability to [personalize your campaign content](https://www.mautic.org/blog/the-power-of-personal-emails/). Whether it’s a list, segment, or individual, personalization leads to conversions. Meet your customers with content that applies to them, addresses their unique needs, and caters to their particular buying process. With campaign personalization, you content reach and conversion will see their highest possible levels. So keep collecting that data, continually adapt your content to fit your target’s needs, and never stop looking for opportunities to optimize.

Whether you’re a small business owner, enterprise, nonprofit, marketer or student, learning the skills needed for marketing automation has tremendous power and value. The results you can produce with the right help and a strong strategy will make any and all effort worth your investment.

*Find the resources you need to understand marketing as a whole and build a solid foundation with core principles. From that point you can approach marketing automation with context and direction.*

Make sure your investment in training matches that of your expectation. Learning the principles and practices of marketing automation is a worthy and attainable goal.Don’t throw all of your money at a service provider if you can do it yourself. Use free open source software to develop your skills, it’s much easier with the right resources and a strong community to offer support.


	- Start building campaigns and practicing your marketing automation skills.
	- Send your “baby” on its way and make sure to analyze the valuable data you from your campaign
	- Specialize your marketing automation skills through optimization techniques and campaign testing
	- Keep learning!


Nothing worth having is easily attained, but don’t make it harder for yourself. Use your new skills to work smarter, **automate your marketing**, increase your reach and achieve measurable growth. Marketing automation isn’t a system you will perfect in a day, but it is well worth the effort. Tackle the learning curve head on by investing your time, not your budget, and see what [do-it-yourself marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org) can do for you.', 'So you’re thinking about implementing marketing automation into your business plan…that’s excellent! It means you are taking your marketing seriously, looking for new outlets and hoping to grow your business by sharing your product or service.

Familiarize yourself with the basic <span style="text-decoration: underline;">principles</span> and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">features</span> of automation and put that in context with what you already know about marketing.

Generally, marketing automation is a means of taking the tedious or repetitive tasks, like monitoring leads or sending emails, and automating them. While marketing automation includes many other functions such as: social media tracking, lead behavior tracking, scoring, and 1:1 real-time marketing, it is primarily a smarter, faster, and larger means of reaching specific individuals with an automated series of event triggered communication workflows. Of course, you will learn all about the details and how to make the process more effective, but for now check out marketing automation education materials to learn more.

If you choose to do marketing automation research by visiting service providers sites, don’t let persuasive sales reps push you to make a decision, lay out all of your options for your marketing solutions before you commit any of your budget. Find out what features your business requires and determine what means you will use to achieve their implementation. Whether it is you or an employee who will be focusing on marketing automation, training is the most vital element in your future success.
<h3>3. Invest in Training</h3>
Your real primary investment should be in training and the development of your general marketing skills, alongside marketing automation education. No matter how much money you spend on the capabilities of your marketing automation software, your campaign is only as good as your ability to effectively address every detail of your marketing strategy.

If you do not have the staff to invest in marketing automation training, you might have to find a different course of action. This could mean hiring specialized marketers, increasing your investment in training, or outsourcing your marketing automation to professionals. Regardless of what course you choose, learning the processes is a must.

Whatever your experience in digital marketing, development, or automation, you should make every effort to seek out education through training materials and hands-on development. Some marketing automation providers offer access to learning materials and user group meetings, but only if your pay their exorbitant service rates. Free training resources are available through a nonprofit organization. Mautic is an open source marketing automation community, whose goal is to create community support for marketers, educational resources, and training courses to support their free marketing automation software.
<h3>4. Build Your First Campaign</h3>
Once you’ve learned the basics and gone through some training, it’s time for you to put it all together and <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/campaign-building/">build your first campaign</a>. This is an exciting time as you finally get to put your new skills to work. Start with the most basic of your campaign building skills; the key points of your strategy. From there you can further develop each of your campaign points in the framework of marketing automation. Just remember to start simple.
<ul>
	<li>Create your campaign strategy</li>
	<li>Define your elements</li>
	<li><a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/landing-page-love/">Design simple emails, landing pages and forms</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/drip-campaign-infographic/">Build your workflow</a></li>
	<li>Measure your results.</li>
</ul>
Remember, it’s your first campaign, so it may not be perfect, but it can become much better if you learn from the experience and use the data you get to make your next campaign even better. With this approach, continued learning, and a positive attitude, you are well on your way to becoming a marketing automation professional.
<h3>5. Analyze Your Campaign Results</h3>
The feedback you get from your campaigns is what drives marketing automation progress and leads to long term development and success. The most powerful brands utilize the data from every measure of a campaign’s activity and engagement. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Metrics</span> help marketers to design better sites, landing pages, keywords, email subjects, and any other measurable factor. These metrics allow brands to interpret engagement and consumer behavior in order to consistently improve every detail of their campaign''s design, content, and delivery. The goal is to achieve an optimal level of engagement, by separating your market from the crowd, meeting your leads wherever they are in the customer lifecycle.

As you continue to develop your marketing automation skills, and the ability to interpret your campaign reports, you will find more ways to collect valuable data. One such strategy is that of "split campaigns” or <strong>A/B testing</strong>. By creating two slightly different campaigns and comparing the resulting analytics in defined element fields, marketers can quickly adapt their content or design to their customer’s preference. These unconscious influencers make all the difference with marketing automation, where customer behavior triggers exactly the action you need to drive your message home and to start turning leads into conversions and revenue. Developing your marketing automation skills even further makes you that much more powerful as a marketer and yields stronger growth, so what’s next?
<h3>6. Specialize &amp; Optimize Your Marketing Automation Skills</h3>
Once you have acquired a good understand of the things we have just discussed you will find that each campaign element can be more effectively tested and designed. You may have found what you are already good at, whether it’s <a href="https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/landing-page/">landing page design</a>, content writing, customer cycle “<a href="https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/">drip flow</a>” campaigns, or <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/email-marketing-level-one/">email campaigns</a>, but what about the elements that could be better?

The key to improving individual campaign elements is in optimization. Whether it’s <a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/keyword-research-part-1/">SEO</a> (the ability to influence the visibility of your website or web page to a search engines parameters or "organic reach") or <a href="http://searchengineland.com/guide/seo/content-search-engine-ranking">Content</a> Optimization (understanding the way that keywords influence search result, as well as meta-descriptions, alt-tagging, and increased credibility), understanding optimization tactics is crucial to continued development of your campaigns.

One powerful tool that marketing automation provides is the ability to <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/the-power-of-personal-emails/">personalize your campaign content</a>. Whether it’s a list, segment, or individual, personalization leads to conversions. Meet your customers with content that applies to them, addresses their unique needs, and caters to their particular buying process. With campaign personalization, you content reach and conversion will see their highest possible levels. So keep collecting that data, continually adapt your content to fit your target’s needs, and never stop looking for opportunities to optimize.

Whether you’re a small business owner, enterprise, nonprofit, marketer or student, learning the skills needed for marketing automation has tremendous power and value. The results you can produce with the right help and a strong strategy will make any and all effort worth your investment.

<em>Find the resources you need to understand marketing as a whole and build a solid foundation with core principles. From that point you can approach marketing automation with context and direction.</em>

Make sure your investment in training matches that of your expectation. Learning the principles and practices of marketing automation is a worthy and attainable goal.Don’t throw all of your money at a service provider if you can do it yourself. Use free open source software to develop your skills, it’s much easier with the right resources and a strong community to offer support.
<ul>
	<li>Start building campaigns and practicing your marketing automation skills.</li>
	<li>Send your “baby” on its way and make sure to analyze the valuable data you from your campaign</li>
	<li>Specialize your marketing automation skills through optimization techniques and campaign testing</li>
	<li>Keep learning!</li>
</ul>
Nothing worth having is easily attained, but don’t make it harder for yourself. Use your new skills to work smarter, <strong>automate your marketing</strong>, increase your reach and achieve measurable growth. Marketing automation isn’t a system you will perfect in a day, but it is well worth the effort. Tackle the learning curve head on by investing your time, not your budget, and see what <a href="https://www.mautic.org">do-it-yourself marketing automation</a> can do for you.', '2015-08-12 17:36:12', 1, '2015-08-12 17:36:12', '2015-08-12 17:39:51');

From the uniqueness of the open source marketing automation concept to the processes used in developing our software, we wanted to pave a new way, even if it means doing things the hard way.  

    Don’t misunderstand, the struggle has been well worth the results as marketers, organizers, and small business owners around the globe fall in love with Mautic. Plus everything about the software didn’t have to be difficult, it **simply had to be right**. That’s why Mautic chose to develop with [Symfony](http://symfony.com/). Our programmers are the ones turning vision into reality and they''re doing it with the latest, most powerful frameworks available. For nearly a decade, Symfony has been doing the same thing and we’re totally on board with their philosophy.  

 
>  Symfony is a set of PHP Components, a Web Application framework, a Philosophy, and a Community — all working together in harmony. 
 At Mautic, we think that’s pretty cool.  

 
### Symbiotic Relationship
 Being [community-driven](community) and open source, we are always thinking about growth and scalability. Our marketing equality project has already begun to take on a life of it’s own, but we have made sure that the foundation for all subsequent development stands up to the needs of our users and the desires of developers. Future improvements will be that much more powerful because of the strong and ever-developing Symfony framework, which is exactly what we need for scalability and consistency in our software.  

 Check out the [full list](http://symfony.com/projects/mautic) of components utilized by Mautic on the [Symfony website](http://symfony.com/projects/mautic).  

 Learn more about PHP components, Symfony’s web application frameworks, training and resources by visiting their [website](http://symfony.com/) or reading the [wiki article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symfony).  

 
### Try It Out
 See for yourself how Mautic has used Symfony to create powerful, beautiful, open source marketing automation. Take our software for a free test drive on our [demo page](demo), create your own [hosted account ](https://www.mautic.com/)(free forever), or [download](download) the software today at [Mautic.org](https://www.mautic.org/).

Plus everything about the software didn’t have to be difficult, it <strong>simply had to be right</strong>. That’s why Mautic chose to develop with <a href="http://symfony.com/">Symfony</a>. Our programmers are the ones turning vision into reality and they''re doing it with the latest, most powerful frameworks available. For nearly a decade, Symfony has been doing the same thing and we’re totally on board with their philosophy.</p> <blockquote> Symfony is a set of PHP Components, a Web Application framework, a Philosophy, and a Community — all working together in harmony. </blockquote> <p>At Mautic, we think that’s pretty cool.</p> <h3>Symbiotic Relationship</h3> <p>Being <a href="community">community-driven</a> and open source, we are always thinking about growth and scalability. Our marketing equality project has already begun to take on a life of it’s own, but we have made sure that the foundation for all subsequent development stands up to the needs of our users and the desires of developers. Future improvements will be that much more powerful because of the strong and ever-developing Symfony framework, which is exactly what we need for scalability and consistency in our software.</p> <p>Check out the <a href="http://symfony.com/projects/mautic">full list</a> of components utilized by Mautic on the <a href="http://symfony.com/projects/mautic">Symfony website</a>.</p> <p>Learn more about PHP components, Symfony’s web application frameworks, training and resources by visiting their <a href="http://symfony.com/">website</a> or reading the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symfony">wiki article</a>.</p> <h3>Try It Out</h3> <p>See for yourself how Mautic has used Symfony to create powerful, beautiful, open source marketing automation. Take our software for a free test drive on our <a href="demo">demo page</a>, create your own <a href="https://www.mautic.com/">hosted account </a>(free forever), or <a href="download">download</a> the software today at <a href="https://www.mautic.org/">Mautic.org</a>.</p> <p>Check out the code behind the applications by visiting Mautic’s <a href="https://github.com/mautic">GitHub repository</a> and get involved in the development of the world’s only open source marketing automation.</p> <p>Let’s build great things together.

    It never seems to fail that just when you''re about to release something you find a problem that needs a solution. Of course Mautic is no different. This 1.0.0 release candidate is full of solutions. We have taken this last opportunity for massive improvements to make some incredible changes. All for the better and all tested and ready for you to use. This release candidate addresses a total of **92 improvements** (we prefer to not call any of them *bugs*).   

  
### Notable Improvement
 We have one improvement which we have deemed worthy of a notable mention. In this release we have modified the page and routing structure to better support friendly URL''s and improve readability of the routing. Don''t worry though, we are fully backwards compatible with the older URL''s so nothing will break. Moving forward all of your "internal" or secure pages will be located behind a URL with `/s/` in the URL. (e.g. Login page is now `http://your-mautic.com/s/login`). This is for a good reason. Now your landing pages and other public pages are much simpler and prettier!  

  
### All Other Improvements
 You can read a full detailed list of all the other fixes and features on [GitHub](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1). Read and you''ll be amazed at all that has gone into this release. It''s incredible to see this many improvements in such a short time. **Seriously, go read this! **

We are redefining the image of open source software by giving you a program that isn’t just powerful in its functionality, but beautiful by design.

### Mautic VIP
 This week we recognize the skills and contributions of Akarawuth Tamrareang for his incredible dedication to open source projects and to sharing Mautic in Thailand. Check out the Thai Mautic.org locale - very impressive!  

 
### We asked him to share his story with the Mautic community.
 Akarawuth Tamrareang (aka Krit or Open Source Wizard) is the Managing Director of Marvelic Engine Co., Ltd. Akarawuth has a long history with open source development and since 2004 he has led a group of CMS professionals who specialize in open source systems. His experience is truly impressive with work in Joomla!, Mambo, WordPress, e-commerce solutions like VirtueMart, CitrusCart, vtigerCRM, and his own FLEXIcontent; a content construction kit for Joomla!  

 In addition to his extensive development work, Akarawuth has also played leadership and organizer roles in a variety of events and organizations including:  

 
 - Joomla Translation Working Group (Thai/Lao) - Joomla Day in Thailand: the biggest event for Joomla users in Thailand. - Joomla Training Seminars hosted monthly for both individuals and students - Joomla lectures at many events - Mentor for the Google Summer of Code program - Joomla Bug Squad - Former OSM board member - President of Open Source Education and Development Association - Leader of Joomla User Group Bangkok 
 We asked Krit a few questions about his interest and involvement in Mautic. He was kind enough to give us some great insights.  

    

 
#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic?
 Mautic interested me because it seemed to answer to all my questions and provided a great solution for the open source community in Thailand. I discovered Mautic through Github from David’s account ([https://github.com/dbhurley](https://github.com/dbhurley)) then I found information about [Allyde.com](https://allyde.com) and [Mautic.com](https://mautic.com). It''s such a useful tool for marketers and offers a wide range of new features.  

    

 
#### What is your vision for Mautic and how do you see that effecting businesses in Thailand?
 All new social media platforms in Thailand experience very rapid growth. Thais are very keen on social media right now (such as Instagram, Twitter and especially Facebook). Mautic is an amazing tool to help marketer analyze their clients and to keep track of their campaigns with in-depth analysis and results. Also, many users are already experienced with open source platforms such as Joomla, Wordpress and vTigerCRM. Mautic has provided a complete business model for businesses and organizations in Thailand.  

    

 ------ The Mautic community owes a grand gesture of support to Akarawuth for his enthusiasm and extensive contributions. Thank you on behalf of the entire Mautic community!

One of the cornerstones of any good marketing automation system and an integral piece of creating a good system for lead nurturing is the landing page.  




Landing pages are those special pages you create on your website to collect the users information and in return you provide them with some “reward”. This reward can take the form of a download, a PDF, a white paper, or any number of other resources which the user is interested in. Maybe you have an awesome video that demonstrates how to perform a task. Before the user is able to watch the video they must fill out a short unobtrusive form. The form may ask just for their name and their email address, it might ask them a few other pertinent questions if it relates directly to the item they are interested in. This landing page is gold for you. It allows you to collect relevant information directly from users who are genuinely interested in what you’re offering. There’s a level of commitment the user must be willing to make to fill out a form in exchange for what you give them. This page which we’ve just defined is a landing page. And you may begin to see already why I refer to it as gold. **Landing pages are golden opportunities.** But if you’re not careful and if you don’t construct a good landing page then they will be wasted opportunities. Let’s look now at those things which make a strong and highly engaging landing page.

### 1. A Single Strong Focus

The focus of the page is one of the first things to consider when creating a landing page. Your landing page should convey a clear, easy to understand purpose. Why do you want the user to visit this page and what is the reason they are here. Answer this question and only this question. This may be the hardest part of the entire process. Do not overcomplicate the purpose for this page. Take your time and determine what the single most important reason for the page. When you come up with other ideas (and trust me you will) write them down somewhere else as other potential landing pages. Once you have defined your focus write out your page content. Remember the goal here is to keep it simple, concise and to the point. Keep your sentences short and a minimum number of paragraphs. Here’s some good examples.

![RightSignature Landing Page marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/rightsignature_landing.png)


RightSignature does a great job of focusing the purpose of a page to a single form. Good graphics and a simple form drive the user to a single action.

![Wistia Landing Page marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wistia_landing.png)


Wistia gives a great video overview (which is good since they''re a video company) and a very easy one form field button.

![Acquia Landing Page marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/acquia_landing.png)


[Acquia](http://acquia.com) may ask for a few more fields but you can easily understand the purpose of the page and what you would receive in return for filling out their form.

 

### 2. A Simple Call to Action

As you write your content you will want to keep in mind what is the action you want the user to take? In most cases you’re probably going to want them to fill out a form so you can collect some information about them. But that’s not always the only call to action. Maybe you want the user to sign up for a newsletter, or schedule a meeting. Regardless of the specifics of the action your landing page needs a simple call to action. Don’t overcomplicate the call to action, don’t obscure the call to action. You don’t want your user to be confused with what they should do when they arrive on your landing page and a clear call to action will keep them comfortable that they are in control and they know what they should do. Here are a few great simple call to actions.

![Zoho Landing Page marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/zoho_landing.png)


It doesn''t get more simple than a single button. [Zoho](http://zoho.com) has simplified their call to action all the way down to a single button on their landing page.

![Shopify Landing Page Marketing Automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shopify_landing.png)


[Shopify](http://shopify.com) lets you create your online store with only an email and your name. Again, the focus on a very simple and yet effective call to action.

 

### 3. A Low Commitment Level

This third tip for showing your landing page some love involves making your page have a very low commitment level. You want the user to complete the call to action. If you make the page easy to understand, give the user the steps they should complete and provide them a means to do so without taking too much effort you will have a much higher conversion rate. The user may have just met your company, they may not know you or what you offer and they don’t want to jump immediately into an intense relationship. If you think about your landing page as a commitment then you want to make that commitment as easy and as simple as possible. This will reassure your user and make them more comfortable with introducing themselves. Take a look at these low commitment landing pages.

![Geico Landing Page Marketing Automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/geico_landing.png)


The process of shopping for car insurance can be a bit overwhelming. [Geico](http://geico.com) makes their landing page simple with a very low commitment by only asking for a zip code on the first page to get you started.

![Podio Landing Page Marketing Automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/podio_landing.png)


[Podio](http://podio.com) also makes the experience very easy by only requesting an email address. They reiterate the fact that your sign-up is completely free emphasizing the fact that the commitment is minimal.

 

### 4. A Quick Reward

Once your user has read your landing page, followed your simple call to action and made that initial commitment then they need to be rewarded and rewarded quickly. This reward is the original resource, asset or item the page originally promised. In the example given above this is the video the user came to the page to view. **Providing an immediate reward is the best way to reinforce the commitment the user has made and reassure them to be confident in their decision.** When you create your landing page keep this end result in mind. Be sure you are rewarding those users who are completing your call to action. This one is a bit harder to show real examples but I believe it’s rather self-evident as well.

Landing pages are a powerful resource to generate new leads for your business. Landing pages provide valuable information to you but also to your users. They receive something and you receive something. It’s a wonderful start to a potential long-term relationship. Don’t neglect this opportunity and show your landing pages some love. I hope these 4 tips will give you some ideas to help you create amazing landing pages.', '<p class="lead"><em><strong>Update:</strong> Mobile landing pages are an aspect of your marketing automation you simply cannot ignore!

 If you’re still not sure what Mautic is or does, here it is in a simple sentence:   

 
##  Mautic helps you know your audience, listen to them and build a lasting relationship. 
 If you’re looking to save time, increase sales, and improve your life then you should take a look at what Mautic is doing. I think you’ll soon discover exactly why Mautic is on top of the world. Come see for yourself. You’ll love the view from the top!

 Ruth has been a long-time advocate of open source solutions and has a history dedicated to the field of digital technology. She is the CEO and Co-Founder of [Virya Group Limited](http://viryagroup.com/), a full-service, tech-focused digital agency which specializes in the use and promotion of open source technologies.  

    


### Mautic Meetups & More
 Ruth recently turned her expertise and skills to Mautic and began getting involved with our community. She saw and believed in our community vision and quickly looked for ways in which she could put her talents to use making Mautic better. Ruth organized a local Mautic Meetup in her area of the UK. But she didn’t stop there, not only did she create several different meetups but she took it one step further and organized a special first-ever doc sprint. In other words, Ruth got people to come out and work on improving the documentation for Mautic. Why? Because she wanted it make Mautic easier for everyone to setup and use. **That’s amazing!** That’s the type of thing which makes her standout as a Mautic MVP.

Not sure where to get started with something as overwhelming as marketing automation? We’ve got a great suggestion: Don’t jump directly into the deep end.  


A system as large as Mautic can be both exciting and intimidating. Rather than trying to step in and implement everything all at once consider an alternative. Most businesses are eager to keep in contact with their users and consider email marketing as a primary means for doing this. Instead of creating an account for email marketing and paying large sums of money on a monthly basis just for the purpose of sending emails to your contacts you can take advantage of Mautic to do the same thing. Later, as you have time you an begin to implement other Mautic-features into your business flow.

Here is a short 3 step guide for creating an email marketing campaign with Mautic.



### Step 1: Create Your List

Just as when you are working with an email marketing client you need to define a list of the leads you want to interact with. This could be a list of customers or a list of leads. You can enter these email addresses manually or you can mass-import them easily from a CSV file. (This means you can export them from your existing system and import them directly into Mautic.) Creating this list allows you to quickly filter and group your leads for use in your campaigns later.

### Step 2: Create Your Emails

The second step is the central piece of this guide. You have to write your emails. This takes a bit of time and you should think carefully about the content and structure of each email. Remember that you will be sending these over a time period and your leads will be receiving them gradually. Make sure the content flows smoothly from one email to the next and provide plenty of opportunities for quick review of previous content. Also, be sure to follow standard best practices for every detail of your email. You want to ensure a maximum number of reads, opens, and click-throughs. You can do this by following some basic principles of good email marketing. We’ll review these principles in another blog post.

### Step 3: Define Your Basic Campaign

The final step in the process of using Mautic for email marketing involves [creating a basic campaign](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/). Before you panic thinking this campaign process will be too much to understand realize that we will only be creating the most basic of workflows. That’s right for an email marketing campaign like we are defining you simply need to add emails to the campaign builder and define a time delay before sending the next email. Nothing else. We’re not talking about any fancy drip-flow campaigns, decision trees, or anything complex. We’re simply organizing a timeline for emails to be sent.

Implementing these three steps will allow you to immediately begin using Mautic to handle all of your email marketing as you would do with other software. Over time as you become more familiar with the various other aspects of Mautic you will be able to expand on this foundation to a more robust marketing system. This is the beauty of Mautic. This is power in simplicity. When you are ready to do more, Mautic is ready to help.

  Some jobs require you to work on the weekend. We get that. Some jobs have weekend shifts. But there are some jobs where you’ve been working like a frantic person all week, you’ve met yourself coming and going more than once, and here you are, on a Saturday, still working. If you fall into that last category, well, we think you’ve got a problem. Wait! Don’t leave. We also think we have a solution!

We [wrote early this week about email marketing](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/email-marketing-level-one) and how you can use marketing automation to help you. If you find yourself agreeing with this article then definitely go read that post. We also shared some really cool stats about email on our social media channels throughout the week.

We think if you took just a few minutes to setup some automated emails you would find yourself with more time. More time during the work week to get everything done. More time to spend doing what you should be doing on the weekend.   

 
### Improve Your Time
  Marketing automation can sound like a daunting task. Email marketing even sounds a bit tricky. But if you stop and take it one little piece at a time you’ll soon find you’re more efficient than ever. That’s what Mautic is all about! Helping you become more efficient so you can spend your work time doing what you **could** be doing. And your weekend time doing what you **want** to be doing.

We believe [automated marketing](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/) can still be personal.  


There is a multitude of evidence pointing to the increased effectiveness of sending personal emails versus a corporate newsletter type of email.

There are plenty of times when you find yourself sending almost the identical email multiple times to different individuals. When you find yourself in one of these situations you should stop and think - is there a better way. The answer is yes. Mautic gives you the power of sending automated (and personal) email messages.



So what does a personal email look like? We’re glad you asked. There used to be the idea that just using a name in the salutation line would be enough to consider your email “personal”. But we believe it’s much more than just how you address someone. Being personal is a number of things and a "Dear John" is only the beginning, in more ways than one.

**Personal emails mean they come from you and not your business.** This means you should send email not from a generic corporate or organization email address but from a personal address. This is important for several reasons. First, if you send from a personal email address your recipients are far more likely to open your email because it feels like a personal message from you to them. Second, many times your personal address will have an avatar associated with it that will cause your leads to recognize your face in their inbox.
![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/mautic_leadfields_email.png)
  


**Personal emails are more unique than just the beginning.** This means customizations and personalizations should occur throughout the email. Lead fields, product specific information and other unique aspects of each lead should be used throughout the email. Admittedly this is a bit of a fine line as you don’t want to pretend there is a strong relationship with a potential lead when they don’t believe there is. And you certainly don’t want to compromise a potentially good relationship by appearing to impersonal. This takes time and practice.

**Personal emails look personal and not like a corporate newsletter. ** Don’t send emails meant to engage users that look like they are a standard HTML newsletter meant to simply share the latest sales and special offers. You know exactly the type of email we’re talking about. There is certainly a time and a place to send newsletters to your users.

We believe we should never disorient the user by moving too quickly or cause detrimental effects to how a user experiences Mautic.

In order for Mautic to move at this speed and maintain this dedication to the user experience we must move with purpose. Our bug fixes must address the issues found with incredible speed; while new features should improve and enhance the user experience.

### Release Version?

Lastly, you’ll notice we’re not making a huge deal about the version number. For all the developers in the room, we are using semantic versioning, this affects when we release certain features, but we believe most users should never have to worry about version upgrades and specific numbers. Mautic strives to always offer seamless upgrades through an intuitive user interface. New version? Simply click the button and watch the upgrade happen. The version number shouldn’t matter, instead you’ll notice the issues fixed, and new features are enabled.

If you want to see a more detailed breakdown of what’s been **fixed** and **featured** in this release check out the [release notes on GitHub](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/tag/1.1.0) or in the [forums](https://www.mautic.org/community/index.php/414-1-1-0-released).

    Recently we were discussing our options for a tool that would let us test Mautic in a browser most efficiently and across a wide range of platforms and browsers. As we looked at the various options one rose to the surface. BrowserStack is a cross-browser testing tool, to test public websites and protected servers, on a cloud infrastructure of desktop and mobile browsers. Easy enough? Here’s the lowdown.    

 Instead of creating multiple virtual machines on your own computer, or using a half-dozen different machines and operating systems you can use BrowserStack to see what your website or web application looks like across a bazillion devices at once. Every OS, desktop, laptop, mobile and more. Clearly this would be super beneficial to our community and we were excited to see how we could use it in our dev. Without a moment’s hesitation we reached out to the founders and told them a bit about what we were doing. And then we waited.   

 We couldn’t believe how quickly we heard back from them and were even more excited to with their response. They enthusiastically supported what we were doing.

**52%** is an incredibly high percentage of your visitors. In addition to that general statistic, it’s also important to keep in mind that the majority of those visitors on a mobile device **begin with a search engine query**. That means before they visit your site they are on a search engine results page looking for something in particular. They see a link to your site that appears to answer their question and they follow the link. What happens next is crucial.

### Step 1: Landing Pages

If you are designing your website to be mobile-friendly then you have conquered step one. Congratulations your website is mobile ready and perhaps you’re using responsive web design to accomplish this goal. You’ve realized the importance of having a mobile presence and you’ve focused some time preparing for this traffic. But this is only step one. If you truly want to see the most success then you need to do more than just re-format your existing website content to fit within a smaller screen. **You need to create mobile-specific landing pages. **

As every good marketer knows, the landing page is the key to a quick conversion. Having a compelling landing page gives the user just the right amount of information mixed with a quick and easy call-to-action to encourage that next step in the sales process. Landing pages have their own set of guidelines and best practices, we’ve actually discussed this previously on the Mautic blog, and you can read this article, [Landing Page Love](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/landing-page-love), if you want to review some features of a good landing page. But mobile landing pages need a slightly different approach. **Mobile first landing pages need to take into account several things**:

### 1. Mobile Landing Pages Load Insanely Fast

The first thing you should consider when designing landing pages for mobile devices is the speed at which the page initially loads. Keep in mind that with mobile devices there is a very strong possibility the traffic is coming over a cellular network. These data connections can be much slower than you might find with a traditional computer-based internet connection. Not always of course, but for the most part these devices will load content slower. This means anything that does not specifically relate to this exact page should be discarded or removed.

If you want your visitors to be able to quickly scroll through your mobile landing page then you need to provide them with the content they are seeking quickly and efficiently. Cut down on the javascript files, the extra css, and the many other desktop-centric features of your page that will not even be used by a mobile visitor. **Make your page load insanely fast.**

### 2. Mobile Landing Pages Need Unique Propositions

When a visitor lands on your website from their mobile device the odds are much higher they are not simply browsing but they are specifically looking for something. Whether this be an answer to a question, a potential new product, or a service, these visitors are coming with a purpose. Your mobile landing page should be highly focused on returning information to your visitors. This information should not be general details about your great service offerings, or your amazing product, instead your information should be highly configured as a response to the content of their search queries.

Your mobile landing pages should be dynamic and offer exact answers to the query string from the referrer. By providing your visitors with the answer they are seeking they will be far more inclined to read more. These unique propositions may be similar to what you would offer on a desktop landing page but the focus should be highly tuned for the mobile browser.

### 3. Mobile Landing Pages Need Minimal Feedback

Your mobile landing page should not be a page-long form with input boxes and tons of requirements. We all know that feeling of trying to fill out a form on a mobile device as the page is expanded and shrunk and you try to scroll around to the various input fields. That frustration should never happen when browsing on a good mobile landing page. Remember, if you collect just the basic details on a mobile landing page you can always collect more information later via other forms. Plus, the visitor will be more likely to return to the site from a desktop browser later if they have previously submitted some information.

A strong mobile landing page should request the absolute minimum amount of information from your visitors. They should be organized and structured to fit within a mobile browser and they should change the input type (keyboard layout) automatically based on the context of the field (e.g. an email address).

### 4. Mobile Landing Pages Are Just The Beginning

Creating a mobile landing page should be looked at as the beginning of a longer relationship. This first point of contact should be quick to engage and quick to encourage a return visit. When you think of a mobile landing page as just the first step you’ll design it to be interesting, eye-catching, and sticky. You don’t want to overwhelm you simply want to inform. A strong mobile landing page like this will capture just a little bit of information from your visitors, not enough to give a headache when filling out a form, but enough to encourage them to return at a later time.

Don’t think you have to give every bit of information to your visitors on a mobile landing page. You’ll do much better if you remember that a mobile landing page is just the beginning of a potentially long and happy relationship with your new visitor.

Mobile landing pages are an incredibly important part of any marketing strategy and should not be neglected. As we see more and more traffic coming from mobile devices we need to be more aware than ever how we target these mobile devices. Specific landing pages created for these browsers will play an ever-increasing role in your marketing success and the eventual success of your business.', '<p class="lead">Recently we shared a statistic about the ever-increasing amount of web traffic coming purely from mobile devices.</p>

 So you’re relatively new to marketing and you’re learning the best way to start working with ongoing marketing tools.  

     ------ You know you need to take advantage of social media, email marketing, and other methods of marketing to keep things updated and stay engaged with your target audience. You also know you are only one person and you have a limited number of hours in your day. You may have done a quick Google search to try to find answers. Maybe you were familiar with marketing automation terminology, maybe you weren’t. Either way, you’ve found this article and you should be glad you did. In the next several steps we’ll discuss how to get started with your first automated marketing campaign.  

  There are a number of steps you should implement to create your first automated marketing campaign and we’ll look at each on in turn. We’ve discussed some of these previously and we’ll link to them when necessary. We will also put relevant information, links, and resources inline within the article whenever possible. Of course if you are reading this as a seasoned professional and see areas for improvement your comments and suggestions are most welcome.  

  
## 1. Identify your target audience
 The first step in your marketing campaign will be to determine who your target audience is and how you want to reach them. What are the key characteristics of your ideal customer? There are a number of ways you can determine your target audience and identify the market.  

 ![identify your target audience](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/target_audience.png)
  

  Often a good place to begin starts with a thorough review of the problem you wish to solve and the needs you are meeting with your product or solution. Be sure you can clearly define what you do and what your business does. If you can’t define this, how can you expect your customers to do so? Most startups are keenly aware of this need to start with your goals. They commonly refer to this quick and easy sharing of their goals as their **elevator pitch**.   

 ![amazing elevator pitch](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/elevator_pitch.png)
  

 
### Elevator Pitch Definition
 An elevator pitch is basically a 30-second breakdown of your business. You’ll define the problem that exists, your solution, and the size of the market you’re addressing. The size of the market is where you begin to determine what represents your target audience. Based on the problem and your solution, you can begin to identify who is affected by this problem and thus begin to outline your target audience.   

  
  
#### 5 important things regarding an elevator pitch
 
1. Find a good hook 3. What’s your mission 5. Tell them what makes you different 7. Back it up with data 9. Keep it under 60 seconds 
 ------ *<small><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/5-keys-to-a-great-elevator-pitch-1" target="_blank" title="great elevator pitch deck">https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/5-keys-to-a-great-elevator-pitch-1</a></small>*  

  
#### You must be able to explain your solution simply!
 ![explain it simply einstein quote](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/explain_it_simply.png)
   

 
### Personas
 The next part of this target audience identification involves creating a few personas. Don’t worry with the terminology. The concept of personas is a simple one. This is where you use your imagination. Pretend you’re someone else. Give yourself a new name, a new job description, and a new purpose; then review the solutions to the problem your business had previously identified. Is it interesting? Does it meet your new needs as this imaginary person? That’s the idea behind personas. Create several different types of people that may visit your website or look at your solution. These personas will help you later in your marketing campaigns. In this part of the process simply recognize what a persona is, how to create them, and the purpose they serve in helping you define your target audience.  

   
> Creating personas yields 2x the open rate, and 5x the click-through rate.>

   The Buffer blog has some fantastic examples of personas and how they used them to improve their product offering. According to Buffer,  
> "Building personas for your core audience can help improve the way you solve problems for your customers."
    

You can read the full blog article on [their website](https://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide?ref=mautic). For the purpose of this article we’ll simply suggest creating personas as a means for helping you identify your target audience.   

  
## 2. Create a Marketing Plan
 The next thing you’ll need to undertake is the creation of your marketing plan. Here you’ll identify what your goals and objectives are for your campaign. This is the main reason why creating your target audience is an important first step. You cannot create an effective marketing plan without first identifying to whom you are marketing. Your marketing plan is incredibly important and what will ultimately control your entire campaign. Since this plan is so important you must pay close attention to every detail. Here are some key points to consider when creating your marketing plan.  

  Your marketing plan should be somewhat cyclical in nature. It should consist of multiple pieces but ultimately they will fit somewhat together into a nice, recurring circle that follows this pattern:  

  ![marketing campaign steps](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/analyze_write_publish_promote.png)
   

 There are many other aspects that will fit into this pattern but overall from a high level you should see this pattern emerge.  

  Marketing plans allow you to identify your methods for marketing, your marketing costs, and the time involved with the various parts of your campaign. Don’t panic about your marketing costs as there are many different tools available to help you [calculate your budget](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/54436).  

  So what does a good marketing plan look like? **Here’s a quick example of the key elements found in a good marketing plan**.  

  
 2. **Target Customers:** The first step is to identify your target customers (you did this already in Step 1, so you should be able to fill this out quickly). 4. **Unique Selling Proposition:** Again, this can be drawn from your elevator pitch which you may have completed already.  6. **Pricing and Positioning Strategy:** You need to identify your pricing strategy as part of your marketing campaign, this is an important step and should not be overlooked. Keep in mind your target customer and your user personas you previously created. 8. **Distribution Plan: ** Outline how you plan to distribute your content. You’ll be writing content, creating infographics, producing videos, and organizing social posts. Create a guide for how you plan to distribute these various assets.  10. **Marketing Materials:** Your marketing plan should also describe your marketing materials. What resources will you be creating to help you with your distribution plan? This is not creating those resources but identifying them. You’ll work on creating them later in the campaign. 12. **Online Strategy:** Your online strategy is how you plan to handle your marketing in terms of social media and other online outlets (press releases, third-party website posting, and forums).  14. **Conversion Strategy:** As part of a marketing plan you should outline your strategy for converting your leads to customers. This conversion strategy should not be ignored and should be done as realistically as possible. Refer to industry averages and other metrics to help create an obtainable conversion rate.  16. **Referral Strategy:** Are you interested in how your customers help build your brand? Your marketing plan should outline your strategy for handling referrals from existing customers and leads.  18. **Retention Strategy:** The cost difference between acquiring a new customer and retaining an existing customer is a well-known statistic. When building your marketing plan don’t neglect defining how you plan to keep your current customers happy. 20. **Financial Projections:** Financial projections are the last aspect we’ll discuss in creating a marketing plan. Every good marketing plan should outline your anticipated outcomes. Build these numbers from your target audience, your pricing strategy, and your conversion strategy. You’ll be estimating of course but completing this step will help you stay focused on your marketing plan and give you a goal to achieve.

## 3. Collect Lead Information
 Now that you have a strong handle on your target audience and you’ve created a comprehensive marketing plan you are ready to begin collecting your leads that match your criteria. This is the first step where you will begin creating things in your marketing automation software. There are several ways you can go about collecting lead information; we’ll look at the two most common and a third which should be discouraged.   

  **1. You can collect lead information through a form submission on your website.** These forms can be built through your marketing automation tool and then embedded directly within your website pages, or be added to a specific landing page which can also be created within your marketing automation tool. If you have question or problems with building landing pages then you may be interested in checking out this article on our blog about creating an [amazing landing page](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/landing-page-love). There are of course many ways to build a landing page, and a strong marketing automation tool should allow you to dynamically build these pages. Don’t forget in today’s world you should also be sure to put a strong emphasis on [mobile specific landing pages](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/mobile-landing-pages)! This is the most common method for collecting lead information.  

  **2. A second method for lead collection is through manual addition of lead information one at a time to your platform.** This is of course a far more tedious method and requires a good bit more amount of direct interaction. However, every time you are at an event, or in a meeting and collect a business card or two, you should add these leads to the appropriate list. This is a much more difficult method but still a valid way for building your lists.   

  **Don’t do this: **The final way for building your lists is one which should (in most cases) be avoided. Buying lead lists for importing into your marketing. This is generally frowned upon and does not allow your campaign to be built correctly. It is recommended that you never buy a lead list. You don’t want to be associated with spammers.    

  
## 4. Create Your Content
 Now that you’ve defined your target audience, created a strong marketing plan and collected your lead information you are ready to begin creating your content. This content are those items you’ve described previously in your marketing plan and relates to many different forms of media. Common content items include blog articles, graphics, social posts, infographics, and videos. This is a critical step in the process. You must create your content with purpose and invest in what you share. This means taking time to write the longer blog articles. Spend the money and work on an infographic. No one cares to see fluff material. Creating high quality content is a sure fire way to increase your conversions and make your campaign successful.  

  Content marketers agree that original content is far better than curated or syndicated content. A recent statistic shows the breakdown this way:  

  ![marketing statistic by content creation type](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/content_creation_type.png)
  

  **Bottom line: It’s worth your time to create your own original content.** If we look at another statistic from [InsideView](http://socialmediab2b.com/2012/03/b2b-social-media-leads-infographic) we see that companies with active blogs generate **67% more leads per month**. That’s a significant number. Clearly, content creation is important. But there’s a key piece to consider. Your content absolutely must be relevant to your target audience. This is why the first step in any good marketing campaign and campaign building must start with identifying your target audience. Need a statistic?   

  
> **Approximately 60-70% of all B2B content is never used because the topic is irrelevant **([InboundWriter](http://www.inboundwriter.com/content-marketing/8-new-content-marketing-stats-prove-quality-content-king/))
 Wow. You simply must have the right target audience in mind when creating your content.  

  Of course blogging and written content is only one aspect of a good campaign. You must engage with your target audience on a number of platforms including video, graphics, and social as well. Globally video posts per person on Facebook have grown 75% year over year. (via Facebook IQ). Video is a huge  part of any marketing strategy these days. Video blended with social media is even more popular. Since Facebook released their own video distribution platform it has grown significantly in traction and opportunities for marketing has grown as well. **Don’t be afraid to try new tools to increase your campaigns.**

 Visual content is one of the central aspects of the top 5 most effective B2B marketing tactics. ([HubSpot](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy)).  

  
## 5. Creating Content Sharing Strategies
 After you’ve created your original content you’re ready to begin organizing your connection strategies. This is how you want to share your content with your target audience. You will want to identify the main ways you wish to engage your audience. In the case of most, email marketing is a central aspect. We’ve published articles before about the popularity and significance of email marketing. You can read this article about [getting started with email marketing](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/email-marketing-level-one), or you can also check out this article about the [power of using personalization in your email messages](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/the-power-of-personal-emails).     

These are just a few articles on the power of email marketing and when working with a marketing automation platform you will want to organize and create your emails as part of your campaign building process. This is something you’ll do before you launch your campaign. By building your emails before you start laying out your campaign in the campaign builder you will have all the pieces ready to use.   

  ![email marketing roi](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/email_roi.png)
  

  Creating emails in a marketing tool are relatively easy and most offer a similar set of features. You will want to make sure you add personalization to your email messages; this involves the address, and also the content tuned to specific use cases (or personas). Remember those personas you built earlier? Now is the time to put those into practice. Write your emails based on those audience types and then fine tune them with some personal details. Usually you’ll do this through “tokens”, these are lead fields that your marketing automation software will inject into the email. Think of it a bit like old school mail merge functionality.   

  You can also create tweets, and other social media posts as part of your campaign process, you can do this ahead of time but usually this is easy enough (and short enough) that you can create these types of elements directly during the campaign building.   

  
## 6. Build Your Campaign
 And now, finally, you are ready to create your campaign. Don’t stress. Even though it seems like it has taken a significant amount of time to get to this point every step has been an important part of arriving at the campaign building stage. Now that you’ve already completed the first five steps you are ready to quickly and easily build your campaign.   

  Your marketing automation platform should have a graphical campaign builder. This is a cornerstone of any strong marketing automation software and is important in providing you with a quick, easy, and yet powerful way to organize your campaign. You should be able to see at a high-level view every piece of your campaign and every step.  

  Let’s break down campaign building into 3 easy sections and then look at each in more detail. The three main stages of any campaign are as follows: 1. A starting point, 2. Actions and Decisions, 3. Outcomes  

 
### Starting Point
 First, we’ll look at the starting point. This will be how your leads are added to this campaign. In most software platforms there are couple of ways you can add leads to a campaign. The most common involves a form submission. This means simply when a lead completes and submits a form they are automatically added to a campaign. So in your campaign builder you will want to begin your campaign structure by adding a form submission. That’s option one for adding a lead to a new campaign. The second option involves the use of lead lists. You can also have leads added to a campaign based on the lead list they are associated with (and yes, leads can be on multiple lists). In this option whenever a lead is assigned to a lead list that list can be a starting point for a campaign. In the campaign builder you will simply select which lists are the starting point for you campaign. By doing this any lead associated with that list will be part of the campaign. And any new lead added to that list will automatically be added to the campaign as well.  

   ![marketing automation campaign building](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/campaig_source_leadlist.jpg)
  

  
### Actions & Decisions
 The second aspect of campaign building involves actions and decisions. This is where you add specific actions that you (the company) are taking during the campaign. These actions consist of things like creating and sharing a landing page, sending an email, sending tweet, pushing the lead to an integration, or updating a lead’s points, details, or even campaigns. Now don’t get overwhelmed because that sounds like a long list. We’ll look quickly at each of these actions.  

  
#### Actions
 
 2. **Adjust Lead Points.** This is a way you can help keep track of your lead’s potential value or interest. Adding points lets you score your leads and rank them based on interests. Adding or removing points from a lead is one action you can take as part of your campaign process.   4. **Change Campaigns.** Changing a lead’s campaigns is another action you can take. This may sound confusing but it’s really quite simple. You can move a lead from the current campaign to a new campaign; or even add them to additional campaigns while remaining on the existing one.  6. **Modifying a Lead’s Lists.** By modifying the lists for a particular lead you can effectively categorize your leads, organize them, and even manage their campaigns. (Remember: a lead list can be a starting point for a campaign).   8. **Push Lead to Integration.** This is an incredibly powerful action you can take as part of a campaign. Pushing a lead to an integration means you can have that lead automatically added to your CRM, or other software system you are using in your business. You could even have a notification sent to a team chat client if you chose. Pushing a lead to a different integration allows you to further refine how you contact that lead. This does not have to be the final step in a campaign. Pushing a lead is simply one more action you can take during a campaign.  9. **Send Email.** This is perhaps the most common action taken in a campaign. Sending an email to the leads on a campaign is one of the primary forms of interaction with your leads and is also perhaps the simplest action to understand.  11. **Update Lead.** The last action we’ll discuss involves updating a lead. As part of a campaign you can initiate an action to update information about a lead. Changing their details and updating their information can be a useful and simple action to take as part of a campaign builder.  
 Remember, there are many different actions and this is only a few of the more common types of actions you will see in building a campaign. Actions are your way of connecting with your leads. The alternate or response to these actions are typically labeled as decisions.  

  
#### Decisions
 Decisions are the response initiated by the lead. Leads respond to your actions with decisions and these serve as a form of a trigger within your campaign builder. As with actions there are a variety of decisions a lead can initiate: Downloading an asset (or resource), opening an email, submitting a form, or visiting a page. These are a few of the more common examples of decisions you may use as part of your marketing campaign building. As with actions we’ll look at each.  

  
 2. **Downloading an asset.** Whenever you provide content to the lead which they can then download or access directly you can mark these resources as an asset and track the response. For example, consider the case where you’ve created a white paper PDF about a particular topic. You want to share this information with your leads and allow them to download the PDF. The lead can then decide whether or not to download this asset.  4. **Opening an email.** A lead will receive emails as part of your campaign every time you create an action that sends an email. This is the corresponding decision you will place in your campaign builder in response to the send email action mentioned above. The lead can then decide whether or not to open the email.  6. **Submitting a form.** Whenever a lead is presented with a form to be filled out as part of the campaign they can then decide whether or not to submit the form. This is similar to opening an email, although with this decision they are providing you with additional information based on the form fields you have created.  8. **Visiting a page.** This last decision we will discuss relates to the pages a lead might visit on a website (or multiple websites). You can define this decision to be initial visits, length of stay, number of pages visited or a variety of other defining characteristics. Then the lead “decides” to perform those various things (We quoted this decision because the lead may not realize they are deciding with this option as time spent on page is not a factor they are monitoring as a lead). 
  All in all you will notice one thing in common which each of these decisions. Unlike actions which have a single “path”, a decision has two paths. Put simply, a decision can have a **positive** (accepted path) and a **negative** (unaccepted path). This means your campaign builder will start to show branching and appear to be more complex. It only appears to be more complex, in reality this branching is what makes your campaign building so powerful. You can build your campaign based on the decisions of your leads and perform additional actions as a result of those decisions.   

  
### Campaign Flow Example
 ![marketing campaign flow](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/campaign_flow.jpg)
  

  
### Do it again.
 What now happens is the heart of a good marketing campaign building experience. You begin to iterate over your actions and decisions. You can now begin to build out additional steps based on each decision. Think of it similar to those old books where you chose the ending. (e.g. Go to page 40 if you think he should open the first door, Go to page 72 if you think he should open the second door). This same strategy is what you’re doing with campaign building. This is lead nurturing. This is lead generation done the right way. You’re building a relationship based on mutual interaction. You don’t want your marketing campaigns to be a simple broadcast of information from you to your leads. No one likes being talked at, people like to be talked with.   

  The final step in building a campaign is the addition of outcomes. This is when you are reaching the end of your campaign. The outcome will usually be simply a final action you take on the lead. This outcome doesn’t necessarily require any further decisions by the lead and in essence closes your campaign.   

  These are the essential steps for building a marketing campaign. There are others and there are many different aspects we could discuss but didn’t. One large item which we will be looking at in-depth in a separate article is the discussion of drip campaigns and how those work. Here’s a two sentence explanation to give you an idea.  

  
> Drip campaigns allow you to better identify and target your leads during a campaign based on time intervals. Drip campaigns mean you delay your points of contact (actions) with your leads for either a specific time interval or a specific future date.
  This is an exciting and powerful way to build a campaign strategy as you may have campaigns run for weeks, months, or even years. It all depends on your target audience, the market, and other key factors. We’ll look at these in more detail and define several different drip campaign strategies in a future article.

Maybe you were familiar with marketing automation terminology, maybe you weren’t. Either way, you’ve found this article and you should be glad you did. In the next several steps we’ll discuss how to get started with your first automated marketing campaign.</p> <p> There are a number of steps you should implement to create your first automated marketing campaign and we’ll look at each on in turn. We’ve discussed some of these previously and we’ll link to them when necessary. We will also put relevant information, links, and resources inline within the article whenever possible. Of course if you are reading this as a seasoned professional and see areas for improvement your comments and suggestions are most welcome.</p>  <h2>1. Identify your target audience</h2> <p>The first step in your marketing campaign will be to determine who your target audience is and how you want to reach them. What are the key characteristics of your ideal customer? There are a number of ways you can determine your target audience and identify the market.</p> <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-217" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/target_audience.png" alt="identify your target audience" class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="343" /></p> <p> Often a good place to begin starts with a thorough review of the problem you wish to solve and the needs you are meeting with your product or solution. Be sure you can clearly define what you do and what your business does. If you can’t define this, how can you expect your customers to do so? Most startups are keenly aware of this need to start with your goals. They commonly refer to this quick and easy sharing of their goals as their <strong>elevator pitch</strong>. </p> <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-218" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/elevator_pitch.png" alt="amazing elevator pitch" class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="273" /></p> <h3>Elevator Pitch Definition</h3> <p>An elevator pitch is basically a 30-second breakdown of your business. You’ll define the problem that exists, your solution, and the size of the market you’re addressing. The size of the market is where you begin to determine what represents your target audience. Based on the problem and your solution, you can begin to identify who is affected by this problem and thus begin to outline your target audience. </p><br />  <h4>5 important things regarding an elevator pitch</h4> <ol><li>Find a good hook</li> <li>What’s your mission</li> <li>Tell them what makes you different</li> <li>Back it up with data</li> <li>Keep it under 60 seconds</li> </ol> <hr /> <p class="text-muted"><em><small><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/5-keys-to-a-great-elevator-pitch-1" target="_blank" title="great elevator pitch deck">https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/5-keys-to-a-great-elevator-pitch-1</a></em></small></p>  <h4>You must be able to explain your solution simply!</h4> <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-219" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/explain_it_simply.png" alt="explain it simply einstein quote" class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="371" /> </p> <h3>Personas</h3> <p>The next part of this target audience identification involves creating a few personas. Don’t worry with the terminology. The concept of personas is a simple one. This is where you use your imagination. Pretend you’re someone else. Give yourself a new name, a new job description, and a new purpose; then review the solutions to the problem your business had previously identified. Is it interesting? Does it meet your new needs as this imaginary person? That’s the idea behind personas. Create several different types of people that may visit your website or look at your solution. These personas will help you later in your marketing campaigns. In this part of the process simply recognize what a persona is, how to create them, and the purpose they serve in helping you define your target audience.</p>  <div class="text-center"> <blockquote>Creating personas yields 2x the open rate, and 5x the click-through rate.<br /> <em><small><a href="http://blog.mltcreative.com/ROI-Buyer-Personas-in-B2B-Marketing" target="_blank" title="buyer personas and marketing">http://blog.mltcreative.com/ROI-Buyer-Personas-in-B2B-Marketing</a></small></em></blockquote> </div> <p> The Buffer blog has some fantastic examples of personas and how they used them to improve their product offering. According to Buffer,  <blockquote>"Building personas for your core audience can help improve the way you solve problems for your customers."</blockquote>  <p>You can read the full blog article on <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/marketing-personas-beginners-guide?ref=mautic" target="_blank" title="marketing personas beginner guide">their website</a>. For the purpose of this article we’ll simply suggest creating personas as a means for helping you identify your target audience. </p>  <h2>2. Create a Marketing Plan</h2> <p>The next thing you’ll need to undertake is the creation of your marketing plan. Here you’ll identify what your goals and objectives are for your campaign. This is the main reason why creating your target audience is an important first step. You cannot create an effective marketing plan without first identifying to whom you are marketing. Your marketing plan is incredibly important and what will ultimately control your entire campaign. Since this plan is so important you must pay close attention to every detail. Here are some key points to consider when creating your marketing plan.</p>  <p>Your marketing plan should be somewhat cyclical in nature. It should consist of multiple pieces but ultimately they will fit somewhat together into a nice, recurring circle that follows this pattern:</p>  <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-220" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/analyze_write_publish_promote.png" alt="marketing campaign steps"  class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="500" /> </p> <p>There are many other aspects that will fit into this pattern but overall from a high level you should see this pattern emerge.</p>  <p>Marketing plans allow you to identify your methods for marketing, your marketing costs, and the time involved with the various parts of your campaign. Don’t panic about your marketing costs as there are many different tools available to help you <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/54436" target="_blank" title="calculate marketing budget">calculate your budget</a>.</p>  <p>So what does a good marketing plan look like? <strong>Here’s a quick example of the key elements found in a good marketing plan</strong>.</p>  <ol> <li><strong>Target Customers:</strong> The first step is to identify your target customers (you did this already in Step 1, so you should be able to fill this out quickly).</li> <li><strong>Unique Selling Proposition:</strong> Again, this can be drawn from your elevator pitch which you may have completed already. </li> <li><strong>Pricing and Positioning Strategy:</strong> You need to identify your pricing strategy as part of your marketing campaign, this is an important step and should not be overlooked.

Creating high quality content is a sure fire way to increase your conversions and make your campaign successful.</p>  <p>Content marketers agree that original content is far better than curated or syndicated content. A recent statistic shows the breakdown this way:</p>  <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-221" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/content_creation_type.png" alt="marketing statistic by content creation type"  class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="499" /></p>  <p><strong>Bottom line: It’s worth your time to create your own original content.</strong> If we look at another statistic from <a href="http://socialmediab2b.com/2012/03/b2b-social-media-leads-infographic" target="_blank" title="social media infographic">InsideView</a> we see that companies with active blogs generate <strong>67% more leads per month</strong>. That’s a significant number. Clearly, content creation is important. But there’s a key piece to consider. Your content absolutely must be relevant to your target audience. This is why the first step in any good marketing campaign and campaign building must start with identifying your target audience. Need a statistic? </p>  <blockquote><strong>Approximately 60-70% of all B2B content is never used because the topic is irrelevant </strong>(<a href="http://www.inboundwriter.com/content-marketing/8-new-content-marketing-stats-prove-quality-content-king/" target="_blank" title="content is king">InboundWriter</a>)</blockquote> <p>Wow. You simply must have the right target audience in mind when creating your content.</p>  <p>Of course blogging and written content is only one aspect of a good campaign. You must engage with your target audience on a number of platforms including video, graphics, and social as well. Globally video posts per person on Facebook have grown 75% year over year. (via Facebook IQ). Video is a huge  part of any marketing strategy these days. Video blended with social media is even more popular. Since Facebook released their own video distribution platform it has grown significantly in traction and opportunities for marketing has grown as well. <strong>Don’t be afraid to try new tools to increase your campaigns.</strong> </p>  <p><img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/top_five_visual_b2b.png" alt="Top 5 most effective B2B marketing" class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%"></p> <p>Visual content is one of the central aspects of the top 5 most effective B2B marketing tactics. (<a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/visual-content-marketing-strategy" target="_blank" title="visual content in B2B marketing">HubSpot</a>).</p>  <h2>5. Creating Content Sharing Strategies</h2> <p>After you’ve created your original content you’re ready to begin organizing your connection strategies. This is how you want to share your content with your target audience. You will want to identify the main ways you wish to engage your audience. In the case of most, email marketing is a central aspect. We’ve published articles before about the popularity and significance of email marketing. You can read this article about <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/email-marketing-level-one" title="getting started email marketing">getting started with email marketing</a>, or you can also check out this article about the <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/the-power-of-personal-emails" title="email personalization">power of using personalization in your email messages</a>.   <p>These are just a few articles on the power of email marketing and when working with a marketing automation platform you will want to organize and create your emails as part of your campaign building process. This is something you’ll do before you launch your campaign. By building your emails before you start laying out your campaign in the campaign builder you will have all the pieces ready to use. </p>  <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-223" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/email_roi.png" alt="email marketing roi"  class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="343" /></p>  <p>Creating emails in a marketing tool are relatively easy and most offer a similar set of features. You will want to make sure you add personalization to your email messages; this involves the address, and also the content tuned to specific use cases (or personas). Remember those personas you built earlier? Now is the time to put those into practice. Write your emails based on those audience types and then fine tune them with some personal details. Usually you’ll do this through “tokens”, these are lead fields that your marketing automation software will inject into the email. Think of it a bit like old school mail merge functionality. </p>  <p><div class="alert alert-info">You can also create tweets, and other social media posts as part of your campaign process, you can do this ahead of time but usually this is easy enough (and short enough) that you can create these types of elements directly during the campaign building. </div></p>  <h2>6. Build Your Campaign</h2> <p>And now, finally, you are ready to create your campaign. Don’t stress. Even though it seems like it has taken a significant amount of time to get to this point every step has been an important part of arriving at the campaign building stage. Now that you’ve already completed the first five steps you are ready to quickly and easily build your campaign. </p>  <p>Your marketing automation platform should have a graphical campaign builder. This is a cornerstone of any strong marketing automation software and is important in providing you with a quick, easy, and yet powerful way to organize your campaign. You should be able to see at a high-level view every piece of your campaign and every step.</p>  <p>Let’s break down campaign building into 3 easy sections and then look at each in more detail. The three main stages of any campaign are as follows: 1. A starting point, 2. Actions and Decisions, 3. Outcomes</p> <h3>Starting Point</h3> <p>First, we’ll look at the starting point. This will be how your leads are added to this campaign. In most software platforms there are couple of ways you can add leads to a campaign. The most common involves a form submission. This means simply when a lead completes and submits a form they are automatically added to a campaign. So in your campaign builder you will want to begin your campaign structure by adding a form submission. That’s option one for adding a lead to a new campaign. The second option involves the use of lead lists. You can also have leads added to a campaign based on the lead list they are associated with (and yes, leads can be on multiple lists). In this option whenever a lead is assigned to a lead list that list can be a starting point for a campaign. In the campaign builder you will simply select which lists are the starting point for you campaign. By doing this any lead associated with that list will be part of the campaign. And any new lead added to that list will automatically be added to the campaign as well.</p>   <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-224" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/campaig_source_leadlist.jpg" alt="marketing automation campaign building" class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="329" /></p>  <h3>Actions & Decisions</h3> <p>The second aspect of campaign building involves actions and decisions. This is where you add specific actions that you (the company) are taking during the campaign. These actions consist of things like creating and sharing a landing page, sending an email, sending tweet, pushing the lead to an integration, or updating a lead’s points, details, or even campaigns. Now don’t get overwhelmed because that sounds like a long list. We’ll look quickly at each of these actions.</p>  <h4>Actions</h4> <ol> <li><strong>Adjust Lead Points.</strong> This is a way you can help keep track of your lead’s potential value or interest. Adding points lets you score your leads and rank them based on interests. Adding or removing points from a lead is one action you can take as part of your campaign process. </li>  <li><strong>Change Campaigns.</strong> Changing a lead’s campaigns is another action you can take. This may sound confusing but it’s really quite simple. You can move a lead from the current campaign to a new campaign; or even add them to additional campaigns while remaining on the existing one.</li>  <li><strong>Modifying a Lead’s Lists.</strong> By modifying the lists for a particular lead you can effectively categorize your leads, organize them, and even manage their campaigns. (Remember: a lead list can be a starting point for a campaign). </li>  <li><strong>Push Lead to Integration.</strong> This is an incredibly powerful action you can take as part of a campaign. Pushing a lead to an integration means you can have that lead automatically added to your CRM, or other software system you are using in your business. You could even have a notification sent to a team chat client if you chose. Pushing a lead to a different integration allows you to further refine how you contact that lead. This does not have to be the final step in a campaign. Pushing a lead is simply one more action you can take during a campaign.</liI>  <li><strong>Send Email.</strong> This is perhaps the most common action taken in a campaign. Sending an email to the leads on a campaign is one of the primary forms of interaction with your leads and is also perhaps the simplest action to understand.</li>  <li><strong>Update Lead.</strong> The last action we’ll discuss involves updating a lead. As part of a campaign you can initiate an action to update information about a lead. Changing their details and updating their information can be a useful and simple action to take as part of a campaign builder. </li> </ol> <p>Remember, there are many different actions and this is only a few of the more common types of actions you will see in building a campaign. Actions are your way of connecting with your leads. The alternate or response to these actions are typically labeled as decisions.</p>  <h4>Decisions</h4> <p>Decisions are the response initiated by the lead. Leads respond to your actions with decisions and these serve as a form of a trigger within your campaign builder. As with actions there are a variety of decisions a lead can initiate: Downloading an asset (or resource), opening an email, submitting a form, or visiting a page. These are a few of the more common examples of decisions you may use as part of your marketing campaign building. As with actions we’ll look at each.</p>  <ol> <li><strong>Downloading an asset.</strong> Whenever you provide content to the lead which they can then download or access directly you can mark these resources as an asset and track the response. For example, consider the case where you’ve created a white paper PDF about a particular topic. You want to share this information with your leads and allow them to download the PDF. The lead can then decide whether or not to download this asset.</li>  <li><strong>Opening an email.</strong> A lead will receive emails as part of your campaign every time you create an action that sends an email. This is the corresponding decision you will place in your campaign builder in response to the send email action mentioned above. The lead can then decide whether or not to open the email.</li>  <li><strong>Submitting a form.</strong> Whenever a lead is presented with a form to be filled out as part of the campaign they can then decide whether or not to submit the form. This is similar to opening an email, although with this decision they are providing you with additional information based on the form fields you have created.</li>  <li><strong>Visiting a page.</strong> This last decision we will discuss relates to the pages a lead might visit on a website (or multiple websites). You can define this decision to be initial visits, length of stay, number of pages visited or a variety of other defining characteristics. Then the lead “decides” to perform those various things (We quoted this decision because the lead may not realize they are deciding with this option as time spent on page is not a factor they are monitoring as a lead).</li> </ol>  <p>All in all you will notice one thing in common which each of these decisions. Unlike actions which have a single “path”, a decision has two paths. Put simply, a decision can have a <strong>positive</strong> (accepted path) and a <strong>negative</strong> (unaccepted path). This means your campaign builder will start to show branching and appear to be more complex. It only appears to be more complex, in reality this branching is what makes your campaign building so powerful. You can build your campaign based on the decisions of your leads and perform additional actions as a result of those decisions. </p>  <h3>Campaign Flow Example</h3> <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-225" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/campaign_flow.jpg" alt="marketing campaign flow" class="thumbnail" style="max-width: 100%;" width="750" height="386" /></p>  <h3>Do it again.</h3> <p>What now happens is the heart of a good marketing campaign building experience. You begin to iterate over your actions and decisions. You can now begin to build out additional steps based on each decision. Think of it similar to those old books where you chose the ending. (e.g. Go to page 40 if you think he should open the first door, Go to page 72 if you think he should open the second door). This same strategy is what you’re doing with campaign building. This is lead nurturing. This is lead generation done the right way. You’re building a relationship based on mutual interaction. You don’t want your marketing campaigns to be a simple broadcast of information from you to your leads. No one likes being talked at, people like to be talked with. </p>  <p>The final step in building a campaign is the addition of outcomes. This is when you are reaching the end of your campaign. The outcome will usually be simply a final action you take on the lead. This outcome doesn’t necessarily require any further decisions by the lead and in essence closes your campaign. </p>  <p>These are the essential steps for building a marketing campaign. There are others and there are many different aspects we could discuss but didn’t. One large item which we will be looking at in-depth in a separate article is the discussion of drip campaigns and how those work. Here’s a two sentence explanation to give you an idea.</p>  <blockquote>Drip campaigns allow you to better identify and target your leads during a campaign based on time intervals. Drip campaigns mean you delay your points of contact (actions) with your leads for either a specific time interval or a specific future date.</blockquote>  <p>This is an exciting and powerful way to build a campaign strategy as you may have campaigns run for weeks, months, or even years. It all depends on your target audience, the market, and other key factors. We’ll look at these in more detail and define several different drip campaign strategies in a future article. </p>  <hr />  <p>If this is your first introduction to marketing automation and campaign building we hope you have found this article to be helpful and packed with useful information.

## Definition & Statistics of B2B Marketing
  B2B marketing is not complicated or more difficult than other forms of marketing. However, B2B marketing is most certainly different. As a result of being different there are a number of things which must be considered and handled differently when considering B2B marketing. The best place to begin will be with a strong definition of business-to-business marketing. Once we understand this we can then look at a few statistics involving this form of marketing.  

  
> 
> #### Definition
 B2B (business-to-business) marketing is marketing of products to businesses or other organizations for use in production of goods, for use in general business operations (such as office supplies), or for resale to other consumers, such as a wholesaler selling to a retailer. >   
*[Study.com](https://study.com)* 
  This definition works well for our purposes however we can simplify a few terms and reach possibly a more easy-to-understand one. Business-to-business marketing involves the marketing of product or services between two organizations.  

  This is a very simple definition and yet suits our situation well. Next we’ll review a few statistics related to B2B marketing and then we’ll take this definition to define some key aspects of this form of marketing. Once we’ve identified these key aspects we’ll examine a few strategies for successfully implementing a marketing strategy for business-to-business marketers.  

  
## Some Statistics
 Business-to-business marketing requires different focuses then other marketing areas. And yet there are many similarities as well. Content marketing still holds a very active and central role within B2B marketing. In fact,  

  ![B2B content marketing statistic](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/93_percent_b2b_content_marketing_blog.jpg)
  
*Source: [TopRankBlog.com](http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/05/b2b-content-marketing-statistics-2014)*  

  
> The biggest challenge B2B marketers face in regards to lead generation is generating high-quality leads (61%). >   
*[B2B Technology Marketing Community](http://www.slideshare.net/hschulze/b2-b-lead-generation-report-2013)*
  
> 37% of B2B marketers are using marketing automation to generate leads. >   
 *[MarketingProfs](http://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2013/12161/b2b-lead-generation-trends-for-2014-whats-hot-and-whats-not)*
  After we have reviewed those statistics there is a common theme we can see showing quite clearly. B2B marketing is challenged by identifying high-quality leads, more than half of buying decisions are made before personal contact is made, and yet ultimately only 37% are using any form of marketing automation! There is evidently a very significant missing element. But before we look into why that might be and how to solve this let us next examine the key aspects which are unique to B2B marketing.   

  
## Key Aspects of B2B Marketing
 While business-to-business marketing is merely a form of marketing there are certain key aspects which define this particular marketing strategy. Marketers looking to work in business-to-business environments will need to be comfortable and confident working in the following situations.  

  
### Larger Sale Prices
 Unlike business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing, when marketing within a business-to-business environments you must take into account the purchase prices for these accounts are typically much greater than you will find elsewhere. These higher purchase prices may tend to lead to fewer sales but each at a higher individual price. When working with larger sale prices involves a nurturing process for more is at stake. This nurturing process is the focus of the next key.  

  
### Longer Sales Process
 With higher prices comes more hesitation. This hesitation directly leads to a longer sales process. Each account must be carefully nurtured and lead along this sales process through to a successful sale. This sales process involves multiple points of contact, meetings, and can occur over weeks, or even months. When many business-to-consumer transactions occur within minutes, hours, or at the longest, days; this stands distinctly different.  

  
### Partnerships & Brand Loyalty
 B2C marketing and sales typically lead to a small purchase and possibly no ongoing interaction or relationship. However, B2B marketing is one where the longer sales process and the high price lead to a relationship between the businesses. These are not frivolous decisions made without thought or care. These relationships continue long past the initial purchase and involve ongoing communication and discussion. This leads to a very strong brand loyalty from the purchasing business.  

  
### Committee Purchases
 While most B2C purchases involves a single individual making a purchase, the consumer; in B2B this purchasing decision is typically handled by a committee, or group of key players. These individuals each have a unique role and purpose and represent a different interest of the purchasing business. This committee is part of the reason why the B2B sales cycle is longer and more elaborate. The purchase-by-committee aspect also implies a lead nurturing process must engage across a variety of departments and goals.   

  Now that we have examined the definition of B2B marketing and a few of the key aspects of this specific type of marketing we must now turn our attention to ways in which you can successfully implement this knowledge into a specific marketing campaign. You may find several of these suggestions can be used effectively in many types of marketing. B2B marketing does indeed overlap with other formats and the suggestions shared here can be used in other marketing efforts as well.   

  
## Implementing Successful B2B Marketing
 When creating your marketing strategy for business-to-business these are a few areas you should pay special attention to. Again you may be experienced in these already from your other marketing campaigns but special attention should be paid when working within a B2B environment.   

  
### Content Creation
 Just as with every other type of marketing today you need to focus heavily on content creation. It’s almost wearisome to hear the same tired catchphrase used time and again, but content truly is king. Creating fresh, shareable, informative content is a cornerstone of every good marketing strategy. B2B marketing is no different. You saw the statistic earlier which showed the number of B2B marketers who were using content creation as a marketing strategy. Here another statistic in case you just aren’t completely sold that content marketing is here for the long term.   

  
> "78% of CMOs think custom content is the future of marketing.” >   
*[DemandMetric](http://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic)*
  This percentage is impressive. But how do businesses use content marketing in their B2B strategies? There are nine top goals used to measure the effectiveness of their content marketing. These are shown in the chart below.  

  ![B2B 9 Marketing Goals](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/top_9_b2b_marketing_goals.jpg)
 <small><em>Source: <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/05/b2b-content-marketing-statistics-2014/" title="B2B marketing goals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Top Rank Blog</a></em></small>  

  Notice, interestingly enough that sales actually comes in at the bottom of the list. B2B marketers define 8 other goals as more important than the actual sale. This underscores the importance of the many different aspects of B2B marketing beyond simply landing a sale. This also clearly demonstrates how B2B is different and has different key aspects (as mentioned above).   

  So if content creation is important in the B2B marketing strategies, we should explore how to successfully implement this within your campaign. First, you will need to follow the [basics of creating a marketing campaign](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/campaign-building), just as you would for any other campaign. This involves, identifying your target audience, determining your keywords and then organizing your content. There’s also this [excellent guide](http://webris.org/blog-seo-how-to-optimize-your-blog-for-google/) to help you with this entire process; it’s a thorough article so be prepared to learn when you are ready to begin reading.   

  Creating your content is the first major part of a successful B2B campaign. Writing this content should always remain focused on the goals we’ve outlined above. Don’t try to turn every post into a simple call-to-action purchase page. With this type of marketing you are looking more to build your brand awareness, generate the beginning of a long-term relationship, and engage your potential customers. Truly, you want to nurture them along a sales process; not jump directly into a purchasing situation.   

  
### Social Media
 The second aspect of a strong B2B marketer’s strategy involves the rather obvious social media aspect. Every business must use social media within their marketing campaign and B2B is certainly no different. Social networks are the modern version of radio or television outlets found in old marketing. But more than just a platform for broadcasting a message as yesterday’s technology allowed, today social media allows for brand engagement between the buyer and the seller. And businesses focused on marketing to other businesses must take advantage of this medium as well. But again with a little different angle.  

  
#### B2B vs B2C Social Media
 Social media from a corporation’s perspective is a unique opportunity to engage directly with decision makers. Remember, earlier we discussed that most purchases are handled by committee when working within a B2B environment. But each committee is composed of individuals, and each of those people will typically be on one or more social networks. This means as a brand you need to be able to engage with each of these decision makers where they are.   

  
> **Jay Baer**, one of today’s leading content marketing strategists says, "social media can be MORE transformative for a B2B company than a B2C company."
  He goes on to say, "Are there differences between B2B and B2C social media campaigns? Of course. But those differences are at the tactics layer, not the strategy layer."  
  <small><em><a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/crushing-the-myth-of-b2b-social-media" title="B2B Social Media Myths" target="_blank">http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/crushing-the-myth-of-b2b-social-media/</a></em></small>  

 ------ Social media is important regardless of your target audience. Social media requires consistency, dedication, and a willingness to engage. You need to respond to questions, respond to complaints, and offer helpful advice…*including things that do not directly relate to your products or services.* You must step out of your sales and marketing role and interact with your target audience on a variety of topics. Show interest and exchange more than just marketing materials. B2B users who see a tweet, are more likely to visit a company’s website later.

  Social media platforms are an important way to share the information you’ve created during the content creation step. Don’t ignore posting your content because you are in a B2B environment.   

  
### Campaign Construction
 Understanding the unique way that B2B marketing involves a much longer sales process, a more focused relationship, and a strong brand loyalty will affect how you structure your marketing campaigns. When you begin your campaign construction you must take time into account. This means don’t schedule your beginning to ending campaign workflow to last a single week. Don’t even construct your campaign on a two week schedule. B2B marketing campaigns should be structured over a minimum of 4 weeks. You can have branches of your campaign that end sooner should you have an interested lead ready to move forward faster but your primary campaign should unfold over a much longer time period than a traditional B2C campaign.

*[B2B Marketing](http://www.b2bmarketing.net/news/archive/news-88-b2b-brands-adopt-ma-technology-2018)*
  This massive focus by B2B marketers demonstrates the priority that marketing automation holds within their organization. Marketing automation platforms are ideal for creating a very long automated drip flow campaign. These campaigns are useful not only for identifying new leads over a longer period of time but also quite good at maintaining relationships with existing customers. When you recognize the importance of brand loyalty to B2B marketing and the power of an ongoing relationship you create campaigns that also target your existing customer base. This is one way in which you can get ahead with your B2B marketing. Because marketing automation is still a very fast-growing technology many B2B have not yet tapped fully into the potential of their marketing automation software.   

  Also, B2B marketers that use marketing automation have seen incredibly high improvements in their lead generation percentages: "Businesses using marketing automation to nurture prospects see a 451% increase in qualified leads.” ([Hubspot](http://www.hubspot.com/marketing-statistics)). It seems hard to believe that such a high percentage increase is possible but it’s been proven time and again. Since B2B is focused on providing a brand loyalty and longterm relationship, marketing automation is the perfect tool for this. This basic infographic will show you how to [structure a beginner drip flow campaign](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/drip-campaign-infographic) quickly.   

  Campaign construction does not have to be done only in marketing automation software. While many statistics prove the tremendous value of using these platforms you can still create your campaigns in a variety of ways and using a number of tools. The important part to remember is B2B marketing takes time and your campaigns should be structured to offer a strong, nurturing lead process over a longer period of time than B2C.   

  
### Partnerships
 We’ve touched on this a few times in previous sections but it’s important to keep in mind that B2B marketing is more about building partnerships than it is about making a quick sale. B2B marketers must be looking for and encouraging brand loyalty and long-term partnerships. This can be done using a marketing automation tool as mentioned above. This software can be used for marketing to new leads as well as continuing to build your relationship with existing customers. Different campaigns, different outcomes, but the same software. Building partnerships with B2B marketing is important for several reasons.  

  
#### Trust
 First, we recognize that B2B sales generate a much higher price per sale than other industries. With these larger purchases the ability to trust the business you’re working with is important. You must be able to have faith that the quality of the product or service will meet your standards and that the company will stand behind their product and ensure your success. This is a trust-based relationship, and for good reason. Once that trust is established the partnership can continue for many years to come.   

  
#### Support
 Second, B2B marketing must focus on providing more than merely a product or service for sale. B2B must focus on providing a sense of security to the purchaser. Building a strong brand loyalty often means going the extra mile in supporting your existing customers. Doing the unexpected and looking for ways to improve the relationship. This is a very pro-active position and does require a dedication of time as well as a priority placed on listening.  

  The best way to be pro-active in providing support and service is by first listening to the needs of the customer. Listening not just on direct engagements (phone call or support ticket) but also listening on social media where the customer may not even direct the message to you. This pro-active approach to support is fundamental to building brand loyalty.   

  
#### Quality
 If your B2B marketing is not backed by quality products, engaging support, and a fundamental assurance of reliability then you will not be able to build a lasting partnership. However, when businesses sense that you place quality as a priority this will become quickly evident and will encourage brand loyalty.   

  
#### Loyalty Test
 One of the best ways to get a quick feel on how your B2B clients are feeling about your partnership is through the use of a one-question [Net Promoter Score](http://www.netpromoter.com/why-net-promoter/know) (NPS). You’re probably quite familiar with this strategy already but in case you’re not. The NPS is a single one question form that helps to determine your customer loyalty metric which can be used to gauge a company''s customer relationships.   

  ![Net Promotor Score and Marketing Automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/nps_equation.jpg)
   

  Implementing something like a loyalty metric or test helps to ensure that you stay on target and on point with your marketing. You want to make sure you are building those relationships and partnerships and establishing a customer base that will be loyally devoted to your brand.  

  
### Purchases
 The purchase process in B2B is vastly different from other marketing verticals (as we’ve discussed earlier in this article). So perhaps a good place to begin is by looking at some sample purchase cycles as they specifically relate to B2B.   

  ![Business Buying Cycle](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/business_buying_cycle.jpg)
 <small><em>Source: <a href="http://www.inflexion-point.com/Blog/bid/76415/6-Critical-Milestones-in-the-B2B-Buying-Decision-Process" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="Critical Milestones in B2B Buying process">Inflexion Point</a></em></small>  

  And in this process they are significantly farther along this process before they ever reach out to you. This means your content (see above), your social media impact (above), and your campaign funnels (above) must all be organized fully to assist and help this process that occurs before you ever come into direct contact with your leads.   

  
> “B2B customers are 65-90% of the way through the purchase decision process before they contact your firm!” >   
<small><em><a href="http://heidicohen.com/2015-b2b-purchase-decision-process/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" title="B2B Direct Content">Heidi Cohen</a></em></small>
  While this purchase process may seem tricky and at times convoluted, the case can be made that in B2B marketing you have the best possible situation for using marketing automation and other tools to perform tasks, organize campaigns, and nurture potential leads with little to no personal time spent until they reach a qualified lead status. Of course there’s nothing wrong with early personal contact, but when time is your most valuable resource and your limiting factor you need to be smart in your approach. And as we’ve shared before (power of personal) - automated marketing can still be personal marketing.   

  Once you have nurtured your B2B leads into customers you should never neglect the potential for future purchases. As everyone in marketing knows, it is far easier to keep a customer than to gain a new one. This means focusing not on a single purchase but on the lifetime potential purchases from each customer. Your B2B marketing campaign must consider the lifetime value of each customer and what it will require to build a strong partnership, brand loyalty, and ultimately repeat purchases.   

  
## Takeaway
 Business-to-business marketing is different than other types of marketing. There are several unique characteristics which can present a challenge to marketers looking to shift their focus to B2B marketing. However, once you recognize these characteristics and begin to implement the different tactics above in your B2B marketing you’ll find you are well-equipped to be an excellent B2B marketer.

For some who are not familiar with the details of working in a business-to-business environment this guide provides background, potential roadblocks, and suggestions for successful campaigns.</p>  <!--more-->  <h2>Definition & Statistics of B2B Marketing</h2>  <p>B2B marketing is not complicated or more difficult than other forms of marketing. However, B2B marketing is most certainly different. As a result of being different there are a number of things which must be considered and handled differently when considering B2B marketing. The best place to begin will be with a strong definition of business-to-business marketing. Once we understand this we can then look at a few statistics involving this form of marketing.</p>  <blockquote><h4>Definition</h4> B2B (business-to-business) marketing is marketing of products to businesses or other organizations for use in production of goods, for use in general business operations (such as office supplies), or for resale to other consumers, such as a wholesaler selling to a retailer. <br /><em><a href="https://study.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Study.com</a></em> </blockquote>  <p>This definition works well for our purposes however we can simplify a few terms and reach possibly a more easy-to-understand one. Business-to-business marketing involves the marketing of product or services between two organizations.</p>  <p>This is a very simple definition and yet suits our situation well. Next we’ll review a few statistics related to B2B marketing and then we’ll take this definition to define some key aspects of this form of marketing. Once we’ve identified these key aspects we’ll examine a few strategies for successfully implementing a marketing strategy for business-to-business marketers.</p>  <h2>Some Statistics</h2> <p>Business-to-business marketing requires different focuses then other marketing areas. And yet there are many similarities as well. Content marketing still holds a very active and central role within B2B marketing. In fact,</p>  <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-231" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/93_percent_b2b_content_marketing_blog.jpg" alt="B2B content marketing statistic" style="max-width: 100%;" class="img-rounded" width="750" height="496" /><br /><em>Source: <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/05/b2b-content-marketing-statistics-2014" target="_blank" title="b2b marketing statistic" rel="nofollow">TopRankBlog.com</a></em></p>  <blockquote>The biggest challenge B2B marketers face in regards to lead generation is generating high-quality leads (61%). <br /><em><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/hschulze/b2-b-lead-generation-report-2013" target="_blank" title="B2B marketing challenge" rel="nofollow">B2B Technology Marketing Community</a></em></blockquote>  <blockquote>37% of B2B marketers are using marketing automation to generate leads. <br /> <em><a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/chirp/2013/12161/b2b-lead-generation-trends-for-2014-whats-hot-and-whats-not" target="_blank" title="B2B marketing automation" rel="nofollow">MarketingProfs</a></em></blockquote>  <p>After we have reviewed those statistics there is a common theme we can see showing quite clearly. B2B marketing is challenged by identifying high-quality leads, more than half of buying decisions are made before personal contact is made, and yet ultimately only 37% are using any form of marketing automation! There is evidently a very significant missing element. But before we look into why that might be and how to solve this let us next examine the key aspects which are unique to B2B marketing. </p>  <h2>Key Aspects of B2B Marketing</h2> <p>While business-to-business marketing is merely a form of marketing there are certain key aspects which define this particular marketing strategy. Marketers looking to work in business-to-business environments will need to be comfortable and confident working in the following situations.</p>  <h3>Larger Sale Prices</h3> <p>Unlike business-to-consumer (B2C) marketing, when marketing within a business-to-business environments you must take into account the purchase prices for these accounts are typically much greater than you will find elsewhere. These higher purchase prices may tend to lead to fewer sales but each at a higher individual price. When working with larger sale prices involves a nurturing process for more is at stake. This nurturing process is the focus of the next key.</p>  <h3>Longer Sales Process</h3> <p>With higher prices comes more hesitation. This hesitation directly leads to a longer sales process. Each account must be carefully nurtured and lead along this sales process through to a successful sale. This sales process involves multiple points of contact, meetings, and can occur over weeks, or even months. When many business-to-consumer transactions occur within minutes, hours, or at the longest, days; this stands distinctly different.</p>  <h3>Partnerships & Brand Loyalty</h3> <p>B2C marketing and sales typically lead to a small purchase and possibly no ongoing interaction or relationship. However, B2B marketing is one where the longer sales process and the high price lead to a relationship between the businesses. These are not frivolous decisions made without thought or care. These relationships continue long past the initial purchase and involve ongoing communication and discussion. This leads to a very strong brand loyalty from the purchasing business.</p>  <h3>Committee Purchases</h3> <p>While most B2C purchases involves a single individual making a purchase, the consumer; in B2B this purchasing decision is typically handled by a committee, or group of key players. These individuals each have a unique role and purpose and represent a different interest of the purchasing business. This committee is part of the reason why the B2B sales cycle is longer and more elaborate. The purchase-by-committee aspect also implies a lead nurturing process must engage across a variety of departments and goals. </p>  <p>Now that we have examined the definition of B2B marketing and a few of the key aspects of this specific type of marketing we must now turn our attention to ways in which you can successfully implement this knowledge into a specific marketing campaign. You may find several of these suggestions can be used effectively in many types of marketing. B2B marketing does indeed overlap with other formats and the suggestions shared here can be used in other marketing efforts as well. </p>  <h2>Implementing Successful B2B Marketing</h2> <p>When creating your marketing strategy for business-to-business these are a few areas you should pay special attention to. Again you may be experienced in these already from your other marketing campaigns but special attention should be paid when working within a B2B environment. </p>  <h3>Content Creation</h3> <p>Just as with every other type of marketing today you need to focus heavily on content creation. It’s almost wearisome to hear the same tired catchphrase used time and again, but content truly is king. Creating fresh, shareable, informative content is a cornerstone of every good marketing strategy. B2B marketing is no different. You saw the statistic earlier which showed the number of B2B marketers who were using content creation as a marketing strategy. Here another statistic in case you just aren’t completely sold that content marketing is here for the long term. </p>  <blockquote>"78% of CMOs think custom content is the future of marketing.” <br /><em><a href="http://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank" title="custom content and marketing" rel="nofollow">DemandMetric</a></em></blockquote>  <p>This percentage is impressive. But how do businesses use content marketing in their B2B strategies? There are nine top goals used to measure the effectiveness of their content marketing. These are shown in the chart below.</p>  <p><img class=" size-full wp-image-232" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/top_9_b2b_marketing_goals.jpg" alt="B2B 9 Marketing Goals" style="max-width: 100%;" class="img-rounded thumbnail" width="750" height="436" /> <small><em>Source: <a href="http://www.toprankblog.com/2014/05/b2b-content-marketing-statistics-2014/" title="B2B marketing goals" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Top Rank Blog</a></em></small></p>  <p>Notice, interestingly enough that sales actually comes in at the bottom of the list. B2B marketers define 8 other goals as more important than the actual sale. This underscores the importance of the many different aspects of B2B marketing beyond simply landing a sale. This also clearly demonstrates how B2B is different and has different key aspects (as mentioned above). </p>  <p>So if content creation is important in the B2B marketing strategies, we should explore how to successfully implement this within your campaign. First, you will need to follow the <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/campaign-building" title="Basics of marketing campaign building">basics of creating a marketing campaign</a>, just as you would for any other campaign. This involves, identifying your target audience, determining your keywords and then organizing your content. There’s also this <a href="http://webris.org/blog-seo-how-to-optimize-your-blog-for-google/" target="_blank" title="Comprehensive Blog SEO Guide">excellent guide</a> to help you with this entire process; it’s a thorough article so be prepared to learn when you are ready to begin reading. </p>  <p>Creating your content is the first major part of a successful B2B campaign. Writing this content should always remain focused on the goals we’ve outlined above. Don’t try to turn every post into a simple call-to-action purchase page. With this type of marketing you are looking more to build your brand awareness, generate the beginning of a long-term relationship, and engage your potential customers. Truly, you want to nurture them along a sales process; not jump directly into a purchasing situation. </p>  <h3>Social Media</h3> <p>The second aspect of a strong B2B marketer’s strategy involves the rather obvious social media aspect. Every business must use social media within their marketing campaign and B2B is certainly no different. Social networks are the modern version of radio or television outlets found in old marketing. But more than just a platform for broadcasting a message as yesterday’s technology allowed, today social media allows for brand engagement between the buyer and the seller. And businesses focused on marketing to other businesses must take advantage of this medium as well. But again with a little different angle.</p>  <h4>B2B vs B2C Social Media</h4> <p>Social media from a corporation’s perspective is a unique opportunity to engage directly with decision makers. Remember, earlier we discussed that most purchases are handled by committee when working within a B2B environment. But each committee is composed of individuals, and each of those people will typically be on one or more social networks. This means as a brand you need to be able to engage with each of these decision makers where they are. </p>  <blockquote><strong>Jay Baer</strong>, one of today’s leading content marketing strategists says, "social media can be MORE transformative for a B2B company than a B2C company."</blockquote>  <p>He goes on to say, "Are there differences between B2B and B2C social media campaigns? Of course. But those differences are at the tactics layer, not the strategy layer."<br />  <small><em><a href="http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/crushing-the-myth-of-b2b-social-media" title="B2B Social Media Myths" target="_blank">http://www.convinceandconvert.com/social-media-strategy/crushing-the-myth-of-b2b-social-media/</a></em></small></p> <hr /> <p>Social media is important regardless of your target audience. Social media requires consistency, dedication, and a willingness to engage. You need to respond to questions, respond to complaints, and offer helpful advice…<em>including things that do not directly relate to your products or services.</em> You must step out of your sales and marketing role and interact with your target audience on a variety of topics.

## Existing Tools Being Used
 Examine each of these three tools and recognize how they are used. Identify which you are familiar with and see if the description below is how you also would use them. There is nothing inherently wrong with each of these tools and indeed many businesses find success with them. There is however, something missing.   

  
### The Timeless Contact Form
 There are very few businesses who do not realize the importance of the internet. This is a great starting point and one which has become quite well-known today. One page which exists on almost every website is of course the infamous contact form. This form is used as a way for visitors to easily send a request for contact to the company. This is the equivalent of an old-school open door to a business’s brick-and-mortar store. Only it’s worse. This isn’t an open door to an entire store, but rather an open door to a sales person.  

 ![lead management contact form](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/contact_form.png)
  

 Unfortunately many seem to think this contact form is a fantastic piece of the lead management process. How many customers would be interested in knocking on a door to ask for a sales person? Not nearly as many as most companies would like. Still the contact form is one tool currently used for lead management by most businesses.   

  
### The Infamous Company Newsletter
 This next current marketing tool is another vestige of old-school marketing. The newsletter is similar to the old mailers sent out by companies to all their existing customers. Today this mailer has turned from advertising to existing customers to attempting to advertise to new customers. This is due in part to statistics such as this:  

  
> 70% of email readers open emails from a brand or company in search of a deal, discount, or coupon.>   
The Social Habit
  These types of numbers are the reason why so many companies rely heavily on newsletters for generating new leads. But sending a generic newsletter is not the key of a strong lead management process. Indeed newsletters (emails) are a fantastic way of building a brand and keeping in contact with leads and customers alike, but newsletters alone are not a lead management process.   

  
### The Cutting Edge CRM
 Those businesses working with customer relationship management tools are indeed the most advanced of these businesses using existing tools. These CRM tools let the business collect and organize their customers, manage data about their customers, and keep detailed records regarding each of these customers. The CRM works well for existing customers, and for manually entered leads.

  Many of these businesses do great things with sales teams focused around their CRM and they do well in their process. They do well, but perhaps they are still missing something. Perhaps even still they are lacking something. **There is something missing from their lead management process.**  

  
## The Lead Sales Funnel
 Before we identify this missing piece of the sales lead management process let’s next look at the typical sales funnel and define each of the pieces of this process and the role it plays in the lead management process.   

  ![lead management sales funnel marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/lead_management_sales_funnel.jpg)
  

  This sales funnel is a simplified version of everything implemented in a typical business marketing strategy. But even in this simplified form we can see the main aspects of this funnel. Let’s look at each stage in this funnel.   

  
### The Leads Stage
 In this introductory stage you are simply looking to reach as many potential leads as possible. This is the widest of the stages and most broad form of marketing available to your business. You are seeking here to simply spread your name and your presence to your **potential target market**. This target market is every possible lead who may be interested in your products or services either now or at any point in the future.   

  
### The Prospect Stage
 This is the very large and generic middle piece of the sales funnel. This is the prospect stage or the stage where you as a business must seek to **engage** new leads and persuade them to continue in the sale process. This is a smaller group of leads than the original general stage of all available target audience leads.  

  
### The Customers Stage
 This is the desired outcome stage for all leads. The greater this stage of the funnel the better the business does. These are the leads who have been successfully **converted** from lead to a customer. This is the smallest of the stages and the most desired. This conversion is the stage where businesses tend to focus their time and attentions (obviously due to the direct relation to greater revenues).   

  Now that we have identified the three rather general stages of a sales funnel we must look at what is missing. What is the missing piece in a lead management funnel? Where do businesses fail to properly funnel their leads through the sales process?   

 ------ 
## Marketing Automation: The Missing Piece
 Now let’s explore the missing piece of the lead management process. Marketing automation is a process which has been growing in popularity and usage. In fact, recently the statistic was shared,  

  
> "**98% of all businesses** are seeking to implement a dedicated marketing automation system.">   
 [MediaPost](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/252435/marketing-automation-software-little-used-but-oft.html)
  What an incredible percentage of businesses have recognized the power of marketing automation. This implies that the problem is not in failing to recognize the need for marketing automation but something else. Marketing automation, as stated earlier, is more than software. Marketing automation is a process. This is the missing piece of the lead management process. The implementation and execution of an automated marketing process is of utmost importance and requires a number of key steps. We will spend the next several sections looking at these steps and how to implement them.   

  
### New Visitors
 The first area where marketing automation should be implemented involves new visitors. That’s right, the process of marketing automation begins even in the very top of the sales funnel (Leads/Target). Here is how marketing automation works with new visitors.   

  Upon the very first visit of a lead to your website your marketing automation process will identify and begin tracking their activities. A basic tracking pixel will collect several bits of information and begin building a lead profile for this site visitor. This is not something you must manually do but will be done automatically and silently with every new visitor to you website. Tracking activity of each lead, the pages they visit, the time they spend on each page, all of these activities help to provide better information regarding your new lead.   
### Contacting, Promoting & Marketing
 The next part of the sales funnel where marketing automation helps involves contacting promoting, and marketing to leads and potential leads. Here we begin to filter down into the second stage of the lead funnel we’ve mentioned above (Prospects/Engage). This is the true power of marketing automation and the part of the funnel where marketing automation software and more importantly process is truly the missing piece for many. Here are a few ways this is executed.  

  
#### Landing Pages
 The landing pages are ways in which you can present relevant information to your leads as they visit your website. These dedicated landing pages are created for a specific purpose and with a specific call-to-action. We have written an article previously entitled, [Landing Page Love](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/landing-page-love), which gives details and examples of some great landing pages.   

  
#### Forms
 Remember when we spoke previously of the contact forms used by almost all businesses? These are in fact only one of the many types of forms which can be implemented and used by your marketing. These forms, rather than merely sending an email with the form submissions or collecting them in a single database, would serve to continue to fill-out the lead profiles for each of the visitors who submit the form. Dynamic forms that populate a lead profile are far, far more powerful than a mere submission-to-email form. These forms are also capable of building on top of each other and thus continue to build the lead’s profile as they fill out each form  

  (e.g. you might have one form that collects only email address, and a second form which asks merely for social media handle).   
#### Newsletters & Emails
 The email and the newsletter is a powerful feature of marketing automation. Again, this involves much more than a stale monthly newsletter. As we now have established through the use of website tracking, landing pages, and forms to build a better lead profile we can now use that information to provide relevant information to each through the use of automated emails. More than just mail merge functionality however, marketing automation holds the power of multiple messages based on specific decisions and triggers   

  **This is where marketing automation becomes dominant. This is the heart of the missing piece of the lead management process. This strategy involves multiple points of contact done at just the right time, and without direct involvement from your sales team. **  

  
> Businesses who increase the number of times contacting a lead from 1 to 8 show a massive increase in contact ratios. >   
[Ken Krogue](http://www.kenkrogue.com/best-practices/inside-sales-best-practices-7-ways-in-increase-contact-ratios/)
   **Important**: This process must be done correctly and not in a nagging or obnoxious manner. You don’t want to annoy your potential leads; instead you want to nurture them by providing relevant information and resources when they are most needed.   
### Integrate Everything
 More than merely implementing a marketing automation tool the marketing automation process must be work closely with all the other aspects of your marketing strategy. As you should hopefully see, marketing automation processes should involve every stage of your sales funnel and work to provide a cohesive sales and marketing strategy. Being comprehensive means integrating marketing automation with the various other tools already in use in marketing. Here are a few ways marketing automation should be integrated:  

  
#### 1. With Your Website
 Your marketing automation software and processes must integrate with your website. The reasons for this integration are many and can be seen in several ways above. Notice how the tracking pixel is integrated into the lead profile building process. Integrations with your website help make your marketing process a seamless experience for your leads.   

  
#### 2. With Your Forms
 Again, as mentioned previously, integrating your marketing automation with your forms enables you to build robust lead profiles and continue the process of creating potential customers. Mautic helps in this regard through CMS-specific plugin which allow the dynamic insertion of forms directly within your website. These forms submit information directly back to the marketing automation platform.   

  
#### 3. With Your Email
 Marketing automation must integrate deeply with your email marketing efforts. Integrating these two platforms has not been done often due to the silo that SaaS marketing automation tools employ. [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org), as an open source platform, allows you to select the email marketing software of your choosing and integrate directly. This puts the power of your email within your marketing automation platform. This is a new level of integration and puts you firmly in control of your entire marketing process. Your lead management process begins to become complete.  

  
#### 4. With Your CRM
 The final integration mentioned here is one which most marketing automation tools use and deem to be of high importance. A good marketing automation platform should integrate with your CRM. This is on the other end of the sales funnel. Marketing automation truly stretches the entire length of the funnel. At this end of the sales funnel and lead management process the marketing automation tool will finally integrate your now qualified leads with your CRM tool. Now, when your sales team opens their CRM dashboard they are greeted with a list of highly qualified “hot” leads ready to be personally contacted. You will notice this is the first time your sales team must directly contact potential leads. This marketing automation process must integrate with your CRM. Mautic allows you to integrate with any number of popular CRM systems and offers a powerful API for other integrations as well.   

  
> Marketing automation has historically had a problem with poor integrations* ([VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com/2015/01/03/2015-the-year-marketing-automation-finally-catches-on/)) and as a result has found a somewhat difficult time being truly successful. 
  By the way, Mautic offers dozens of integrations and the open source nature of the code ensures that an unlimited number of additional integrations can (and will be) created.   

 ------ 
## Don’t Give Up
 It is at this point that a word of caution and encouragement should be offered. Proper marketing automation, lead management, and sales funnel completions take time and energy. Very few businesses find overnight success as a result of their lead management process. Remember this statistic,  

  
> "79 percent of marketing leads never convert to sales”>   
HubSpot
  
> "Once it’s up and running, a successful long-term content marketing plan will pay lifelong dividends . If you don’t see those immediately, don’t despair. Just focus on providing your followers with the most engaging content possible.” [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnhall/2014/04/13/content-marketing-is-a-long-term-commitment-not-a-campaign/)
  So, don’t lose heart. Don’t give up. Keep providing strong, relevant content and information. Trust in the process of your sales funnel and your marketing automation and continue to pursue your target audience. As the article above states, remember this is a long-term commitment and not a short campaign.   

 ------ 
## Refine Your Strategies
 Now, while you should not lose heart, and you should continue in your efforts you should also refine your lead management strategies. You should focus your sales funnel and you should constantly seek to improve your lead processes. There are a number of ways in which  you can be sure your strategies are most effective.   

  
### 1. Implementing A/B Testing
 Marketing automation platforms, like Mautic, allow you to create multiple page versions for landing pages and emails. These A/B tests help you to determine which pages are most effective in converting leads. If you are new to A/B testing, here is a short MauticMinuteTM video to help explain the concept.  

  <iframe width="750" height="563" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KjBf5nqY_gY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>  

  It is not a difficult job and one which will lead to wonderful improvements in your return should they be handled correctly. Don’t neglect this opportunity to maximize your return on investments and ultimately improve your lead management and sales funnel.   

  
### 2. Continue Improving
 Once you have identified ways to improve your content, your marketing, and your sales funnel you must do everything you can to continue improving them. Don’t simply identify improvements - implement them! Always be seeking improvements and make the most of your marketing automation process.   

 ------ 
## Reviewing the Funnel
 You have now covered the sales funnel from the broadest aspects of your anonymous, targeted leads all the way to your highly qualified list of hot leads ready for personal contact. You have seen how the marketing automation process is the missing piece of your lead management and how to remedy this problem. The solution lies not in finding the software solution but in implementing the best processes involving every stage of your lead management sales funnel. Remember these key steps:  

  
 2. Marketing automation improves lead management at the highest level of the sales funnel.  4. Marketing automation offers ongoing contact and lead nurturing in the prospecting stage of the lead management process. 6. Marketing automation seamlessly integrates with CRM systems to migrate leads ready for direct, personal contact.  
  Implement these recommendations for your marketing automation process into your sales lead management and you’ll find the missing piece to your sales funnel.

### Transcript

These are the four roads that will lead to a better sales funnel. Not a comprehensive sales lead model but should get you started in the **right** direction.


	2. 

#### The Right Technology



	   - **Know Your Needs**: Before you can select the right technology you need to fully understand the problems you want this technology to solve.
	   - **Prepare to Scale**: Don’t select the marketing software you will use based on your current situation. You expect to be successful; plan for the future.
	   - **Identify Your Costs**: What you spend on the right technology is an investment in your future; identify what you will spend implementing marketing tech.



	4. 

#### The Right Beginning



	   - **Sales Team**: Sales teams and marketing teams must work together to create the best strategy for customer growth.
	   - **Marketing**: Marketing begins when your business begins. There is no such thing as too early to begin marketing.
	   - **Audience**: The identified target audience dictates a sales and marketing focus from the very beginning.



	6. 

#### The Right Campaigns



	   - **Timing**: Campaigns need to be bold in sharing the right information at the right times with your leads.
	   - **Repetition**: Campaigns should always have a clear and distinct purpose or goal to be accomplished.
	   - **Purpose**: Campaigns should be organized to execute at the ideal times.



	8. 

#### The Right Reporting



	   - **Lead Tracking**: Right reporting focuses on lead activity: such as time spent on page, pages visited, and social sharing.
	   - **Engagements**: Reporting should include engagement activity between company and lead.
	   - **Conversions**: Right reporting identifies which pages and forms provide the best conversions.

If you answer yes, then keep reading. If you answer no let’s talk about how much money you’re spending unnecessarily every month on low-converting pay-per-click advertising.   



This article is meant to serve as an in-depth what is content marketing guide. We pack tons of statistics, quotes, and resources into this single marketing bundle to help you as you learn to use content marketing effectively. You can read through everything at one time, or come back time and again and review different sections to help you as you improve your content and your content marketing automation.   



Let’s get started as we normally do by looking at a good working definition. We need to understand what content marketing is and what problems it solves. Here’s a very common definition you’ll find through a standard Google search.   




> > Content marketing is any marketing that involves the creation and sharing of media and publishing content in order to acquire and retain customers.  




That’s a pretty solid definition and is rather easy to understand, unlike some of our previous articles content marketing is not a difficult concept to grasp. Instead, content marketing is a difficult task to complete. There’s several reasons for this difficulty but we’ll get to that later in this article. Now that we have a good example of what content marketing is we need to turn our attentions to what makes this type of marketing so special.   



  


## What makes content marketing special? 

Content marketing is without a doubt a special form of marketing. Content marketing has grown exponentially and has become a staple of every good marketing toolkit. What makes content marketing special and why do so many recognize the value of content? Let’s look at three types of content and see what makes each type special.   




### 1. The Power of Created Content


The first type of content marketing we are calling **created content**. This is unique, original content that you create for your blog or website. The power of created content is immense. The words you write, the resources and media you create have never been seen before. You are imparting your knowledge and your research to others. Google and other search engines love this type of content. And if you are sharing highly valuable information then you are rewarded for this work. Created content is a cornerstone for what makes content marketing special.   




### 2. The Opportunity of Curated Content

Before we discuss the opportunity of **curated content** we need to briefly define what we mean by curated. This can be thought of similar to a museum curator. The job of the museum curator is to find, protect, share, and rotate great pieces of artwork so that others can enjoy them. They spend countless hours seeking out fresh, exciting pieces of art to bring to their exhibits. They  look for those pieces which otherwise would remain hidden, obscured, and unavailable to their museum-goers. This is a great definition and example of curation. Curated content is done in much the same way.  



This is **not** the blind re-sharing of overly popular pieces of content. Good content curation takes time, lots of time, perhaps not as much time as the original, created content we referenced above but certainly more than just a reblog of someone’s old content. Curated content takes thought. Curated content provides added value to the content to be shared.   



  

Curated content is the careful selection and sharing of highly relevant, interesting content previously published by another source with proper attribution given to the original creator.  




### 3. The Success of Co-Authored Content

The last form of content marketing which helps to make this a successful strategy is what we’re labeling co-authored content. This form of content is when you either share your content on someone’s platform (website) or request someone to publish on your blog or website. Co-authored content gives you a couple of ways to generate value in your content marketing.   



First, *off-site content*, the co-authored content which appears on someone else’s website gives you an opportunity to spread the power of your brand through other channels and reach new audiences. These posts are successful because they can often bring strong links and ties back to your website as well.   



Second, *on-site* co-authored content can be highly successful because you are able to demonstrate the quality of your own website and brand through the power of the guest bloggers you have contributing. As you grow and your guest bloggers become more familiar names your credibility in the industry and in the market space grows and becomes more familiar to people as well.   



These are three of the most common aspects of content marketing which help to make this marketing highly successful. These are the common aspects, but what does this content actually look like? What makes up content marketing and what trends are popular currently in this form of marketing? This is the next question we’ll answer.  



  


## What are current trends in content marketing?

Content marketing is a constantly evolving and changing form of marketing. To be an effective content marketer requires paying close attention to trends in society. What new technologies are being used, what forms of content are most read, and what criteria is being observed by search engines when ranking content. All of these are important things to consider when constructing a content marketing strategy and a content roadmap. Be sure to keep this constantly changing nature in mind as you review the following current trends. These may change in the future.  




### 1. Infographics

The infographic format is an incredibly popular way of sharing statistical and chart-based information in an easy-to-read format. Think of an infographic as a very long picture with text, graphics, and charts. No one likes to try to read an excel spreadsheet (ok, maybe a few people do) for most of your audience an infographic which displays key pieces of data in a stylish pie chart, or using some other unique way for sharing the otherwise boring, dry data. Here’s an example:  



[![dripflow campaign infographic](https://www.mautic.org/media/drip_campaign_infographic.png)
](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/drip-campaign-infographic)  




### 2. How-To Content

The second trend we see in content marketing is the prolific use of how-to articles. These types of content are created to share information about how to do something (obviously). Usually you will find how-to posts are useful to convey detailed or tricky information in an easy-to-follow step by step guide. As Google (and other search engines) work to improve their search results to respond to long-tail keywords, full sentence searches, and even the “question search” the how-to content becomes increasingly important. Search engines love this content because it directly answers a question.   




### 3. Research Content

The third trend in content marketing is similar to the previous one. Research content marketing is the presentation of large amounts of data in an exhaustive, highly detailed piece of content. Research content has many different sources, citations, and authoritative links to establish the quality and relevance of the material. Research content is perhaps the most time-consuming and difficult to create of all the current trends we discuss in this guide. This guide is an example of a research type of content.  




### 4. Top 10 List

The “top” lists are very hot trends in content marketing. These list based posts do several things that make them popular for content marketers.  



First, creating “best of” lists gives your audience a very quick way to compare common tools, evaluate their options, and provide a trusted source as a basis for a future decision. When these lists are created the right way they can save your audience valuable time as they do their own research. These lists must be created the right way, because if there is any bias, or perceived favoritism towards a particular product or service the entire post will be disregarded.   



Second, creating list content also encourages those businesses, or individuals who “make the list” to share this content with their audiences. Everyone likes a little recognition and a little praise. If you mention them favorably in your list the chances are good they will share your content with others. Because of the highly social aspect of these lists they are highly popular in today’s content marketing strategies.   




### 5. Slideshares

The final content marketing type we’ll mention as a trending format are slideshares. This form of content marketing has certainly become a very trendy way of distributing content thanks in part to the growing popularity and success of Slideshare.com This type of content marketing allows you to share valuable and informative content in a similar way to a live presentation. In fact, one feature available to Slideshare users is the injection of YouTube videos directly within the presentation. This feature provides a great way to blend searchable content with video presentations.   



Slides are a popular way of sharing content and have become a rich media format for engaging your audience. Many great content marketers will provide recap posts, and summary slides in the form of a slideshare presentation for a longer research or how-to article. We’ve done so as well in our content strategy. Here’s an example.   



We published an extensive article on the topic of [Understanding B2B Marketing](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/understanding-b2b-marketing). You can read the entire article with all the details, or you can quickly skim the following short slideshare.  



<iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/6zOBYJC7NhZisv" width="750" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe>  



As you can see, the Slideshare content format is a compelling way to engage your audience quickly.  



These are five current trends in content marketing and as technology continues to evolve so will these trends. A good marketing expert recognizes the need to stay current and relevant in their content marketing roadmap. We understand what content marketing is, we now know what makes content marketing special and we’ve looked at five trends in content marketing, but next we need to understand the purpose of content marketing. What’s the reason for all this content?   



  


## What is the purpose of content marketing?

All this information is great and we’re beginning to see what makes content marketing special and what the current trends look like, but why bother with content marketing? Is there really any value in this form of marketing? What is the purpose for spending all this time creating, curating, and co-authoring content? These are the questions we want to answer next. We’re going to break down the purpose of content marketing into four main sections.  




### Inform

This is perhaps the most common reason for creating content. Businesses, organizations, and individuals want to inform others about something. It may be a new feature that’s been released, a new service being offered, or a new product that’s been created. Everyone wants to tell the world when they’ve done something new. They want to inform their audience about their “great new accomplishment”. Unfortunately while this is the most common reason for content creation this should probably be the least used type of content marketing. Let’s look at why we believe this. This informative purpose of content marketing is focused usually on the business creating the content not the audience. A content marketing plan which focuses on the business rather than the audience will fail. There’s nothing inherently wrong with using content marketing for the purpose to inform; but use it sparingly.   




> “Marketing used to be about making a myth and telling it. Now it’s about telling a truth and sharing it.“ >   
<small>- Marc Mathieu, Global SVP of Marketing at Unilever</small>



### Educate

This second reason for creating content is closely tied to the first but should not be confused with it. Using content marketing to educate your audience is an important aspect of a good marketing strategy. Educating your audience does a few things for you. First, educational content demonstrates your expertise and skills in a particular field. This educational content will showcase your abilities, talents, and understanding of a subject. When your audience sees this expertise they will come to trust your judgement and opinions. Second, educational content demonstrates your desire to see your audience become smarter. You are giving them the opportunity to grow and to learn. Think of this as a priceless gift you are offering to your audience, the gift of knowledge. You’re sharing what you know, not just to help them today but to help them every day in the future. This is the practical form of the old saying, “teach a person to fish”.  The key differentiating factor between educational content and informational content is who receives the attention.

### Entertain

You may want to create content simply for the purpose of entertainment. There is absolutely nothing wrong with entertaining your audience, and in many cases this is a welcome break from education and information content purposes. Great content marketing plans take this into consideration and plan strategic content whose sole purpose is to entertain the audience. Everyone likes a good laugh now and then. Whether this occurs as part of a presentation or merely as an additional media resource shared during the course of a particular content marketing campaign the results are the same. They show your audience you’re able to be an authoritative source but also have a good time. You can also use content marketing for the purpose of entertaining and demonstrating your ability to laugh at yourself. This takes confidence and security in your own brand image to be done effectively.   




### Establish

We’re calling this final purpose of content marketing establishing. You want to use content marketing to establish your brand, establish your credibility, and establish your position with search engines. There’s no doubt content marketing does all of these things. Establishing your brand through word-of-mouth and off-site references is a primary purpose of content marketing. Everyone wants to be the first result in Google. Everyone. The best way to increase your search engine rankings (SERPs) is through high-quality, consistent, authoritative content. Establishment is a key purpose of content marketing.  This is the purpose we addressed in our initial question - the value of organic search. Content marketing is the most powerful way to improve your organic search results.

But content marketing has some very real negatives. If content marketing were easy then everyone would do it and do it great. Instead, as we mentioned in the initial part of our guide, content marketing is not a tricky concept to understand, but a difficult task to complete. Let’s look quickly at a few of the negative aspects of content marketing.   



  


## What are the negatives of content marketing?

When we examined the definition of content marketing we mentioned that the definition was easy to understand but the task of implementing successful content marketing strategies was difficult. There are several reasons for this difficulty and we’ll look at each of them and how to best handle them.   




> “Content Marketing is a commitment, not a campaign.“ >   
- Jon Buscall, Head of Jontus Media



### 1. Content Marketing is time-consuming. 

Anyone that tries to tell you that the art of crafting original content is quick and easy is telling you a lie. High-quality content, the type of content that will improve your search engine ranking, establish your brand, and educate your audience takes time and attention to detail. Creating original content requires thought and research, a careful approach to statistics and other third-party resources. Curating quality content takes time to read, evaluate, judge, polish, and frame before sharing with your audience. Co-authoring content requires time spent locating and requesting the time and energy of quality writers. All of these aspects take time. Then consider the time taken to create additional resources and media strategies for each of those content pieces. All in all content marketing is time-consuming. Because of this time requirement many simply do not engage in content marketing. They may understand the value of content marketing; but they don’t truly value it enough to dedicate the resources necessary.

When large corporations demonstrate their belief in the importance of content marketing this should be a clear indicator to everyone else. Don’t underestimate the importance or value of great content marketing. Spend the time. Content marketing is worth the investment:  




> Per dollar spent, content marketing generates more than three times the number of leads than paid search does.>

### 2. Content Marketing is tricky

The second difficulty many face in content marketing implementation is the trickiness of doing content marketing “right”. What do we mean by doing content marketing right? Everyone can create content. Many do not create quality content. Your content marketing platform should not be a mass posting tool stuffed with your identified keywords. Bad content marketing means trying to beat the system by mass posting hundreds or thousands of articles in an attempt to rank higher in search engines. This may help you gain a few positions in the short-term but ultimately will bring about your demise. You may think you can beat Google and other search engines. This should not be your goal. Remember, you want high quality content that accomplishes the purposes mentioned earlier. You want to inform, educate, entertain, and establish your brand and your business.   



This is why some consider content marketing tricky. What is right and what is wrong? What’s considered best practice? These are the types of questions you might be inclined to ask. But if you will remember what makes content marketing special, what the purpose of your content marketing is, and what the current trends are you will find yourself naturally creating the right kind of content. Content marketing does not have to be tricky, it simply takes a little common sense.   




### 3. Content Marketing is tempting

We touched a little bit on a tempting aspect of content marketing in the previous point. Massive amounts of articles full of relevant keywords with an immediate boost in your search engine optimization sure sounds appealing. But this thinking is a trap. Remember what our parents always told us growing up, if something is too good to be true…it probably is. Don’t be tempted to spend your time looking for a magic cure, a hidden secret to content marketing that no one else has uncovered. Instead create a marketing plan that accomplishes your goals and follows the right steps. Don’t be tempted by shortcuts that can lead to disaster.   



There’s no denying these are some negative aspects of content marketing. If you are aware of the potential pitfalls you’ll be able to avoid them. Your content can be your strongest asset; be diligent to avoid these negatives.   



  


## How do you use marketing automation with content marketing?

Next we turn our attention to how you can improve your content marketing platform and content tools. Just because you need to be creating all this content yourself does not mean there are not ways to make your life easier. Content marketing automation tools are still highly useful and have a big part to play in your content marketing platform. Here are three ways you can use marketing automation with content marketing.   




### 1. Scheduling content

Marketing automation (MA) platforms are a great way to help you schedule your content marketing plan. Every good marketing automation tool provides campaign creation. These campaigns allow you to organize your content and outreach efforts along a timeline or based on the decisions of your leads. When your target audience and potential leads reach different stages of your campaign you want to provide them with different content. With marketing automation your content can be recycled, re-shared uniquely with each lead at just the right time. Content marketing automation is a real thing. Marketing automation platforms that focus on the power of content marketing do exist and they provide fantastic tools for scheduling content, engaging leads, and converting leads to sales.   




### 2. Share content

Beyond scheduling your content marketing automation can also help you share your content. MA platforms also give you the ability to engage your social media channels with your content. Creating great content is only the first step. Sharing your awesomeness with the world is the second piece of the puzzle. Amazing content marketing does more than just create content. Marketing automation software is a great way to take your content and spread it. You can schedule posts (see the first point above) to automatically be shared to your social networks.  



  

27 million pieces of content are shared every day. (AOL/Nielsen, 2013)  



Sharing content can take two forms. One is the **active sharing** where you engage your audience by broadcasting your content out on your brand social channels. This is the most common and most marketing automation software will let you do this in one form or another. The second way you can share your content is what we’ll call **passive sharing**. This means providing your readers the opportunity to share your content without actively pushing it in front of them. Most of the time this takes the form of social share buttons on your content pages. Marketing automation can also help with this by tracking and aggregating the value of these social buttons, where they perform best, and how to improve overall page structure to increase this social sharing and ultimately conversions. Think A/B testing at this point, if you have questions about A/B testing we’d recommend reviewing this quick 60 second video.

### 3. Save Time

The third way that your marketing automation and content marketing work together is by saving you time. The core purpose of marketing automation involves saving time by helping perform repetitive tasks. While your content marketing must be crafted with care and it requires time to create there are still ways you can save time. Think about all the extra things you do when creating your content marketing plan. Think specifically about those things you do repetitively. Are you spending time contacting your audience via email with every new piece of content? Marketing automation helps you keep in touch automatically (and personally) with your leads. Implementing marketing automation with content marketing creates a powerful one-two punch to delivery and execution of your content strategies.   



As we continue in our guide to content marketing and how to get started we now reach a point where we need to stop and evaluate how our content strategies are working. We want to track the outcomes of our content marketing and measure our performance.   



  


## How do you measure the results of content marketing?

You’re well on your way to creating killer content. You’ve setup a content marketing strategy and you’re identifying which content marketing trends you want to focus on. You’ve written your first couple articles, or created a Slideshare or two, and you’re stuck on what to do next. Maybe you’ve even implement marketing automation software already. Now you need to start looking at how you measure the results of your work. Here are three common ways you can measure the effectiveness and overall opportunity associated with your content marketing.   




### 1. Conversions

It almost goes without saying that the first way you should measure your conversions. Your content marketing is helping to establish your brand and your search results presence. One of the key ways to measure if you are successful in doing this involves how many conversions you see as a result of your efforts. Let’s talk about conversions for a minute. Conversions can be several different things. Conversions might be form submissions, they might be product purchases, they might be phone calls, they might simply be length of time your visitors spend on your website. There are many different types of conversions. These will be unique to your business, industry or vertical market. Your job as a content marketing expert is to identify what conversions are most desirable for you.   



Here again your marketing automation software can help you and make your job easier. MA software can be used to generate reports based on metrics you define. These relate directly to your conversions details. Never worry about manually creating a report to see how effective your marketing efforts are. Marketing software makes this data always available and always up-to-date.   




### 2. Social Engagement

Social media impact is the second way to measure how well your content marketing is performing. Keep in mind you are sharing unique and original content with the purpose of informing, educating and entertaining. Your social engagements will reflect how effective your content is. If you see tweets and re-tweets, shares and re-shares of your articles then you can quickly see which pieces of content are most engaging and receiving the best response. Don’t be hasty to attribute a low social volume with bad content, but do recognize good content is shared.

<p>This article is meant to serve as an in-depth what is content marketing guide. We pack tons of statistics, quotes, and resources into this single marketing bundle to help you as you learn to use content marketing effectively. You can read through everything at one time, or come back time and again and review different sections to help you as you improve your content and your content marketing automation. </p>

<p>Let’s get started as we normally do by looking at a good working definition. We need to understand what content marketing is and what problems it solves. Here’s a very common definition you’ll find through a standard Google search. </p>

<blockquote><p>Content marketing is any marketing that involves the creation and sharing of media and publishing content in order to acquire and retain customers.</p></blockquote>

<p>That’s a pretty solid definition and is rather easy to understand, unlike some of our previous articles content marketing is not a difficult concept to grasp. Instead, content marketing is a difficult task to complete. There’s several reasons for this difficulty but we’ll get to that later in this article. Now that we have a good example of what content marketing is we need to turn our attentions to what makes this type of marketing so special. </p>

<p></p><h2 class="page-header">What makes content marketing special? </h2>
<p>Content marketing is without a doubt a special form of marketing. Content marketing has grown exponentially and has become a staple of every good marketing toolkit. What makes content marketing special and why do so many recognize the value of content? Let’s look at three types of content and see what makes each type special. </p>

<h3>1. The Power of Created Content</h3>
<p>
The first type of content marketing we are calling <strong>created content</strong>. This is unique, original content that you create for your blog or website. The power of created content is immense. The words you write, the resources and media you create have never been seen before. You are imparting your knowledge and your research to others. Google and other search engines love this type of content. And if you are sharing highly valuable information then you are rewarded for this work. Created content is a cornerstone for what makes content marketing special. </p>

<h3>2. The Opportunity of Curated Content</h3>
<p>Before we discuss the opportunity of <strong>curated content</strong> we need to briefly define what we mean by curated. This can be thought of similar to a museum curator. The job of the museum curator is to find, protect, share, and rotate great pieces of artwork so that others can enjoy them. They spend countless hours seeking out fresh, exciting pieces of art to bring to their exhibits. They  look for those pieces which otherwise would remain hidden, obscured, and unavailable to their museum-goers. This is a great definition and example of curation. Curated content is done in much the same way.</p>

<p>This is <strong>not</strong> the blind re-sharing of overly popular pieces of content. Good content curation takes time, lots of time, perhaps not as much time as the original, created content we referenced above but certainly more than just a reblog of someone’s old content. Curated content takes thought. Curated content provides added value to the content to be shared. </p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><div class="media"><div class="media-left media-middle"><p class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></p></div><div class="media-body"><p>Curated content is the careful selection and sharing of highly relevant, interesting content previously published by another source with proper attribution given to the original creator.</p></div></div></div>

<h3>3. The Success of Co-Authored Content</h3>
<p>The last form of content marketing which helps to make this a successful strategy is what we’re labeling co-authored content. This form of content is when you either share your content on someone’s platform (website) or request someone to publish on your blog or website. Co-authored content gives you a couple of ways to generate value in your content marketing. </p>

<p>First, <em>off-site content</em>, the co-authored content which appears on someone else’s website gives you an opportunity to spread the power of your brand through other channels and reach new audiences. These posts are successful because they can often bring strong links and ties back to your website as well. </p>

<p>Second, <em>on-site</em> co-authored content can be highly successful because you are able to demonstrate the quality of your own website and brand through the power of the guest bloggers you have contributing. As you grow and your guest bloggers become more familiar names your credibility in the industry and in the market space grows and becomes more familiar to people as well. </p>

<p>These are three of the most common aspects of content marketing which help to make this marketing highly successful. These are the common aspects, but what does this content actually look like? What makes up content marketing and what trends are popular currently in this form of marketing? This is the next question we’ll answer.</p>

<p></p><h2 class="page-header">What are current trends in content marketing?</h2>
<p>Content marketing is a constantly evolving and changing form of marketing. To be an effective content marketer requires paying close attention to trends in society. What new technologies are being used, what forms of content are most read, and what criteria is being observed by search engines when ranking content. All of these are important things to consider when constructing a content marketing strategy and a content roadmap. Be sure to keep this constantly changing nature in mind as you review the following current trends. These may change in the future.</p>

<h3>1. Infographics</h3>
<p>The infographic format is an incredibly popular way of sharing statistical and chart-based information in an easy-to-read format. Think of an infographic as a very long picture with text, graphics, and charts. No one likes to try to read an excel spreadsheet (ok, maybe a few people do) for most of your audience an infographic which displays key pieces of data in a stylish pie chart, or using some other unique way for sharing the otherwise boring, dry data. Here’s an example:</p>

<p class="text-center"><a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/drip-campaign-infographic" title="dripflow campaign infographic"><img src="https://www.mautic.org/media/drip_campaign_infographic.png" alt="dripflow campaign infographic" style="max-width: 50%;" class="thumbnail" /></a></p>

<h3>2. How-To Content</h3>
<p>The second trend we see in content marketing is the prolific use of how-to articles. These types of content are created to share information about how to do something (obviously). Usually you will find how-to posts are useful to convey detailed or tricky information in an easy-to-follow step by step guide. As Google (and other search engines) work to improve their search results to respond to long-tail keywords, full sentence searches, and even the “question search” the how-to content becomes increasingly important. Search engines love this content because it directly answers a question. </p>

<h3>3. Research Content</h3>
<p>The third trend in content marketing is similar to the previous one. Research content marketing is the presentation of large amounts of data in an exhaustive, highly detailed piece of content. Research content has many different sources, citations, and authoritative links to establish the quality and relevance of the material. Research content is perhaps the most time-consuming and difficult to create of all the current trends we discuss in this guide. This guide is an example of a research type of content.</p>

<h3>4. Top 10 List</h3>
<p>The “top” lists are very hot trends in content marketing. These list based posts do several things that make them popular for content marketers.</p>

<p>First, creating “best of” lists gives your audience a very quick way to compare common tools, evaluate their options, and provide a trusted source as a basis for a future decision. When these lists are created the right way they can save your audience valuable time as they do their own research. These lists must be created the right way, because if there is any bias, or perceived favoritism towards a particular product or service the entire post will be disregarded. </p>

<p>Second, creating list content also encourages those businesses, or individuals who “make the list” to share this content with their audiences. Everyone likes a little recognition and a little praise. If you mention them favorably in your list the chances are good they will share your content with others. Because of the highly social aspect of these lists they are highly popular in today’s content marketing strategies. </p>

<h3>5. Slideshares</h3>
<p>The final content marketing type we’ll mention as a trending format are slideshares. This form of content marketing has certainly become a very trendy way of distributing content thanks in part to the growing popularity and success of Slideshare.com This type of content marketing allows you to share valuable and informative content in a similar way to a live presentation. In fact, one feature available to Slideshare users is the injection of YouTube videos directly within the presentation. This feature provides a great way to blend searchable content with video presentations. </p>

<p>Slides are a popular way of sharing content and have become a rich media format for engaging your audience. Many great content marketers will provide recap posts, and summary slides in the form of a slideshare presentation for a longer research or how-to article. We’ve done so as well in our content strategy. Here’s an example. </p>

<p>We published an extensive article on the topic of <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/understanding-b2b-marketing">Understanding B2B Marketing</a>. You can read the entire article with all the details, or you can quickly skim the following short slideshare.</p>

<p><iframe src="//www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/6zOBYJC7NhZisv" width="750" height="600" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC; border-width:1px; margin-bottom:5px; max-width: 100%;" allowfullscreen> </iframe></p>

<p>As you can see, the Slideshare content format is a compelling way to engage your audience quickly.</p>

<p>These are five current trends in content marketing and as technology continues to evolve so will these trends. A good marketing expert recognizes the need to stay current and relevant in their content marketing roadmap. We understand what content marketing is, we now know what makes content marketing special and we’ve looked at five trends in content marketing, but next we need to understand the purpose of content marketing. What’s the reason for all this content? </p>

<p></p><h2>What is the purpose of content marketing?</h2>
<p>All this information is great and we’re beginning to see what makes content marketing special and what the current trends look like, but why bother with content marketing? Is there really any value in this form of marketing? What is the purpose for spending all this time creating, curating, and co-authoring content? These are the questions we want to answer next. We’re going to break down the purpose of content marketing into four main sections.</p>

<h3>Inform</h3>
<p>This is perhaps the most common reason for creating content. Businesses, organizations, and individuals want to inform others about something. It may be a new feature that’s been released, a new service being offered, or a new product that’s been created. Everyone wants to tell the world when they’ve done something new. They want to inform their audience about their “great new accomplishment”. Unfortunately while this is the most common reason for content creation this should probably be the least used type of content marketing. Let’s look at why we believe this. This informative purpose of content marketing is focused usually on the business creating the content not the audience. A content marketing plan which focuses on the business rather than the audience will fail. There’s nothing inherently wrong with using content marketing for the purpose to inform; but use it sparingly. </p>

<blockquote>“Marketing used to be about making a myth and telling it. Now it’s about telling a truth and sharing it.“ <br /><small>- Marc Mathieu, Global SVP of Marketing at Unilever</small></blockquote>

<h3>Educate</h3>
<p>This second reason for creating content is closely tied to the first but should not be confused with it. Using content marketing to educate your audience is an important aspect of a good marketing strategy. Educating your audience does a few things for you. First, educational content demonstrates your expertise and skills in a particular field. This educational content will showcase your abilities, talents, and understanding of a subject. When your audience sees this expertise they will come to trust your judgement and opinions. Second, educational content demonstrates your desire to see your audience become smarter. You are giving them the opportunity to grow and to learn. Think of this as a priceless gift you are offering to your audience, the gift of knowledge. You’re sharing what you know, not just to help them today but to help them every day in the future. This is the practical form of the old saying, “teach a person to fish”.  The key differentiating factor between educational content and informational content is who receives the attention.</p>

<blockquote>"Make the prospect a more informed buyer with content." <br /><small>- Robert Simon, Four Seasons Hotels</small></blockquote>

<blockquote>82% of consumers feel more positive about a company after reading custom content. <br /><small><a href="http://www.demandmetric.com/content/content-marketing-infographic" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Demand Metric, 2014</a></small></blockquote>

<h3>Entertain</h3>
<p>You may want to create content simply for the purpose of entertainment. There is absolutely nothing wrong with entertaining your audience, and in many cases this is a welcome break from education and information content purposes. Great content marketing plans take this into consideration and plan strategic content whose sole purpose is to entertain the audience. Everyone likes a good laugh now and then. Whether this occurs as part of a presentation or merely as an additional media resource shared during the course of a particular content marketing campaign the results are the same. They show your audience you’re able to be an authoritative source but also have a good time. You can also use content marketing for the purpose of entertaining and demonstrating your ability to laugh at yourself. This takes confidence and security in your own brand image to be done effectively. </p>

<h3>Establish</h3>
<p>We’re calling this final purpose of content marketing establishing. You want to use content marketing to establish your brand, establish your credibility, and establish your position with search engines. There’s no doubt content marketing does all of these things. Establishing your brand through word-of-mouth and off-site references is a primary purpose of content marketing. Everyone wants to be the first result in Google. Everyone. The best way to increase your search engine rankings (SERPs) is through high-quality, consistent, authoritative content. Establishment is a key purpose of content marketing.  This is the purpose we addressed in our initial question - the value of organic search. Content marketing is the most powerful way to improve your organic search results. </p>

<p class="text-center"><img src="https://www.mautic.org/media/organic_stats_results.jpg" alt="content marketing and organic seo" style="max-width: 100%;" class="thumbnail" />
<div style="margin-top: -20px;" class="text-left"><small><a href="https://www.imforza.com/blog/8-seo-stats-that-are-hard-to-ignore/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">ImForza</a></small></div></p>

<p>But content marketing has some very real negatives. If content marketing were easy then everyone would do it and do it great. Instead, as we mentioned in the initial part of our guide, content marketing is not a tricky concept to understand, but a difficult task to complete. Let’s look quickly at a few of the negative aspects of content marketing. </p>

<p></p><h2 class="page-header">What are the negatives of content marketing?</h2>
<p>When we examined the definition of content marketing we mentioned that the definition was easy to understand but the task of implementing successful content marketing strategies was difficult. There are several reasons for this difficulty and we’ll look at each of them and how to best handle them. </p>

<blockquote>“Content Marketing is a commitment, not a campaign.“ <br />- Jon Buscall, Head of Jontus Media</blockquote>

<h3>1. Content Marketing is time-consuming. </h3>
<p>Anyone that tries to tell you that the art of crafting original content is quick and easy is telling you a lie. High-quality content, the type of content that will improve your search engine ranking, establish your brand, and educate your audience takes time and attention to detail. Creating original content requires thought and research, a careful approach to statistics and other third-party resources. Curating quality content takes time to read, evaluate, judge, polish, and frame before sharing with your audience. Co-authoring content requires time spent locating and requesting the time and energy of quality writers. All of these aspects take time. Then consider the time taken to create additional resources and media strategies for each of those content pieces. All in all content marketing is time-consuming. Because of this time requirement many simply do not engage in content marketing. They may understand the value of content marketing; but they don’t truly value it enough to dedicate the resources necessary. 
</p>

<blockquote>Coca-Cola spends more money creating its own content than it does on television advertising, according to Columbia Journalism Review.<br /><small><a href="https://contently.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014_Contently_Ebook_CrisisofConfidence_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contently, 2014</a></small></blockquote>

<blockquote>Red Bull reportedly employs approximately <strong>135 people</strong> just for its media house. <br /><small><a href="https://contently.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/2014_Contently_Ebook_CrisisofConfidence_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Contently, 2014</a></small></blockquote>

<p>When large corporations demonstrate their belief in the importance of content marketing this should be a clear indicator to everyone else. Don’t underestimate the importance or value of great content marketing. Spend the time. Content marketing is worth the investment:</p>

<blockquote>Per dollar spent, content marketing generates more than three times the number of leads than paid search does.<br /><small><a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/mediaeloqua/documents/Content+Marketing+Kapost+Eloqua+ebook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Kapost/Eloqua, 2012</a></small></blockquote>

<h3>2. Content Marketing is tricky</h3>
<p>The second difficulty many face in content marketing implementation is the trickiness of doing content marketing “right”. What do we mean by doing content marketing right? Everyone can create content. Many do not create quality content. Your content marketing platform should not be a mass posting tool stuffed with your identified keywords. Bad content marketing means trying to beat the system by mass posting hundreds or thousands of articles in an attempt to rank higher in search engines. This may help you gain a few positions in the short-term but ultimately will bring about your demise. You may think you can beat Google and other search engines. This should not be your goal. Remember, you want high quality content that accomplishes the purposes mentioned earlier. You want to inform, educate, entertain, and establish your brand and your business. </p>

<p>This is why some consider content marketing tricky. What is right and what is wrong? What’s considered best practice? These are the types of questions you might be inclined to ask. But if you will remember what makes content marketing special, what the purpose of your content marketing is, and what the current trends are you will find yourself naturally creating the right kind of content. Content marketing does not have to be tricky, it simply takes a little common sense. </p>

<h3>3. Content Marketing is tempting</h3>
<p>We touched a little bit on a tempting aspect of content marketing in the previous point. Massive amounts of articles full of relevant keywords with an immediate boost in your search engine optimization sure sounds appealing. But this thinking is a trap. Remember what our parents always told us growing up, if something is too good to be true…it probably is. Don’t be tempted to spend your time looking for a magic cure, a hidden secret to content marketing that no one else has uncovered. Instead create a marketing plan that accomplishes your goals and follows the right steps. Don’t be tempted by shortcuts that can lead to disaster. </p>

<p>There’s no denying these are some negative aspects of content marketing. If you are aware of the potential pitfalls you’ll be able to avoid them. Your content can be your strongest asset; be diligent to avoid these negatives. </p>

<p></p><h2 class="page-header">How do you use marketing automation with content marketing?</h2>
<p>Next we turn our attention to how you can improve your content marketing platform and content tools. Just because you need to be creating all this content yourself does not mean there are not ways to make your life easier. Content marketing automation tools are still highly useful and have a big part to play in your content marketing platform. Here are three ways you can use marketing automation with content marketing. </p>

<h3>1. Scheduling content</h3>
<p>Marketing automation (MA) platforms are a great way to help you schedule your content marketing plan. Every good marketing automation tool provides campaign creation. These campaigns allow you to organize your content and outreach efforts along a timeline or based on the decisions of your leads. When your target audience and potential leads reach different stages of your campaign you want to provide them with different content. With marketing automation your content can be recycled, re-shared uniquely with each lead at just the right time. Content marketing automation is a real thing. Marketing automation platforms that focus on the power of content marketing do exist and they provide fantastic tools for scheduling content, engaging leads, and converting leads to sales. </p>

<h3>2. Share content</h3>
<p>Beyond scheduling your content marketing automation can also help you share your content. MA platforms also give you the ability to engage your social media channels with your content. Creating great content is only the first step. Sharing your awesomeness with the world is the second piece of the puzzle. Amazing content marketing does more than just create content. Marketing automation software is a great way to take your content and spread it. You can schedule posts (see the first point above) to automatically be shared to your social networks.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info"><div class="media"><div class="media-left media-middle"><p class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></p></div><div class="media-body"><p>27 million pieces of content are shared every day. (AOL/Nielsen, 2013)</p></div></div></div>

<p>Sharing content can take two forms. One is the <strong>active sharing</strong> where you engage your audience by broadcasting your content out on your brand social channels. This is the most common and most marketing automation software will let you do this in one form or another. The second way you can share your content is what we’ll call <strong>passive sharing</strong>. This means providing your readers the opportunity to share your content without actively pushing it in front of them. Most of the time this takes the form of social share buttons on your content pages. Marketing automation can also help with this by tracking and aggregating the value of these social buttons, where they perform best, and how to improve overall page structure to increase this social sharing and ultimately conversions. Think A/B testing at this point, if you have questions about A/B testing we’d recommend reviewing this quick 60 second video. </p>

<p><iframe width="750" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KjBf5nqY_gY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

<h3>3. Save Time</h3>
<p>The third way that your marketing automation and content marketing work together is by saving you time. The core purpose of marketing automation involves saving time by helping perform repetitive tasks. While your content marketing must be crafted with care and it requires time to create there are still ways you can save time. Think about all the extra things you do when creating your content marketing plan. Think specifically about those things you do repetitively. Are you spending time contacting your audience via email with every new piece of content? Marketing automation helps you keep in touch automatically (and personally) with your leads. Implementing marketing automation with content marketing creates a powerful one-two punch to delivery and execution of your content strategies. </p>

<p>As we continue in our guide to content marketing and how to get started we now reach a point where we need to stop and evaluate how our content strategies are working. We want to track the outcomes of our content marketing and measure our performance. </p>

<p></p><h2 class="page-header">How do you measure the results of content marketing?</h2>
<p>You’re well on your way to creating killer content. You’ve setup a content marketing strategy and you’re identifying which content marketing trends you want to focus on. You’ve written your first couple articles, or created a Slideshare or two, and you’re stuck on what to do next. Maybe you’ve even implement marketing automation software already. Now you need to start looking at how you measure the results of your work. Here are three common ways you can measure the effectiveness and overall opportunity associated with your content marketing. </p>

<h3>1. Conversions</h3>
<p>It almost goes without saying that the first way you should measure your conversions. Your content marketing is helping to establish your brand and your search results presence. One of the key ways to measure if you are successful in doing this involves how many conversions you see as a result of your efforts. Let’s talk about conversions for a minute. Conversions can be several different things. Conversions might be form submissions, they might be product purchases, they might be phone calls, they might simply be length of time your visitors spend on your website. There are many different types of conversions. These will be unique to your business, industry or vertical market. Your job as a content marketing expert is to identify what conversions are most desirable for you. </p>

<p>Here again your marketing automation software can help you and make your job easier. MA software can be used to generate reports based on metrics you define. These relate directly to your conversions details. Never worry about manually creating a report to see how effective your marketing efforts are. Marketing software makes this data always available and always up-to-date. </p>

<h3>2. Social Engagement</h3>
<p>Social media impact is the second way to measure how well your content marketing is performing. Keep in mind you are sharing unique and original content with the purpose of informing, educating and entertaining. Your social engagements will reflect how effective your content is. If you see tweets and re-tweets, shares and re-shares of your articles then you can quickly see which pieces of content are most engaging and receiving the best response. Don’t be hasty to attribute a low social volume with bad content, but do recognize good content is shared. </p>

<blockquote>“Behind every tweet, share and purchase, there is a person. Care more about the person and less about the share.“ <br /><small>- Shafqat Islam, CEO and Co-Founder at NewsCred</small></blockquote>

<h3>3. Traffic Improvements</h3>
<p>Lastly strong content marketing can be easily measured by the improvement and increase in your site traffic. When your content marketing is effective your search engine rankings will increase. You will be able to see which keywords you are ranking well using and make continued improvements as you go. There are many great tools to help you monitor the results of your content marketing. Here are a few</p>

<p class="well">SEMRush is possibly the most popular of the tools listed here when asking content marketers what they prefer to use. SEMRush offers many of the same features you''ll find in SpyFu or KeywordSpy. They offer a free version with limited results. Plans begin at $69/month.</p>

### 7 Mistakes That Will Doom Your Marketing Automation Implementation

By default, most good entrepreneurs understand marketing. This doesn’t mean that you love executing daily and weekly marketing activities. But it does mean that you respect and appreciate the need for strong marketing efforts. But despite this positive outlook, it can end in doomsday.

### Pro Prankster Perfect Viral Marketing

Using the Car Lister auto-buying platform is as easy as lifting the front wheels of a Ford Escape taxi off the ground. At least that’s what the pranksters at ad agency Thinkmodo wanted you to believe in a recent stunt. Car Lister’s CEO enlisted the New York viral-marketing agency to pull off a stunt to bring more visibility to the site, which allows dealerships and private owners to sell vehicles in a community-like setting with the help of photos and video previews. So Thinkmodo staged a dispute between a New York meter maid and a rude taxi driver who refused to move from an illegal spot.

Yet it was all just a clever scheme to generate viral attention for Car Lister. The stunt illustrates the power of viral videos that spread rapidly online and are then picked up by TV shows for prolonged exposure.

### Study With Major Brands Compares Ad Recall For Mobile and Desktop Promos

When people were asked if they remembered seeing full-page ads, 38 percent recalled seeing the ad on a desktop. Forty-three percent of those who were served the ad on smartphones, tablets and desktops remembered the ad.

Banners had the lowest ad recall rates. Thirty-three percent of people who looked at banner ads on a desktop remembered seeing the ad later. The same percentage of people who saw it on multiple devices remembered seeing ads, meaning that solo desktop banners are just as effective as cross-screen standard ads, even though brands pay extra for smartphone and tablet ads.

Even with negative tweets up 241%, Amazon claims big win overall. The social media sentiments around Amazon took a noticeable turn for the worse during the first 13 hours of Prime Day, which has the e-commerce site offering a slew of deals to celebrate its 20th birthday. Deals like 35 percent off Velveeta Shells & Cheese—on a day the Seattle-based company predicted would rival Black Friday—created negative responses on Facebook and Twitter.

You may have even looked at various solutions you could use to try and get started with marketing automation. But many have probably never heard of marketing automation and that’s certainly okay. The best way to think about marketing automation is by starting with something you may be more familiar with; in this case Customer Relationship Management, or CRM software. Most are familiar with the idea of a CRM and managing customers and clients in some CRM system. Of course the most commonly mentioned name in this space is SalesForce but there are others as well which provide similar features. **Marketing automation can be thought of like a bridge between your leads and your customers.**  




### Marketing automation saves lives

If you’re using a CRM then you’re well on your way to doing something incredible with marketing automation. You can read a [quick tutorial on the topic of marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/) here where we dive into more details and specifics but for now let’s look at how you can take your customer relations management knowledge and apply marketing automation to your setup to improve your life. Yes, it will improve your life.  




### Starting with the familiar CRM

For many, the CRM is a catch-all used to collect data and information about all types of individuals. You may have brand-new leads that have filled out a form on your website, existing contacts from an address book you’ve imported at some point in the past, maybe you’ve entered every business card you’ve ever received into your CRM, or finally you add all existing customers to your system. All of these are fairly common ways that businesses use a CRM. But there’s a problem here. When your sales team (or you) go into your CRM to find new business or stay in touch with existing customers…well it’s a mess. Everything is mixed in, and even if you’re one of the studious that create proper lists you’re still left with doing an enormous amount of work. You create your emails and you send them to your lead lists. You enter updated information when you learn something new about your leads or customers, and you spend hours upon hours trying to figure out which of your leads are the ones you need to contact that are actually interested in purchasing something.   



All of these task have one very important thing in common; they all take time, lots and lots of time. And for most of us time is the one thing we simply don’t have enough of. This is where the true power of marketing automation comes in. M**arketing automation is a process where you can save time by handling a number of repetitive tasks and actions automatically based on lead actions and scheduled events.**   



A key thing to keep in mind when performing marketing automation is the simple truth that [automated marketing can still be personal](https://www.mautic.org/blog/the-power-of-personal-emails/). Simply because you’re scheduling points of contact (emails, social media messages etc…) does not mean you are no longer making a personal contact. Read more on personalization in marketing automation here.  




### So how does marketing automation work with a CRM? 

Marketing automation starts by tracking every lead, or visitor, to your website, or other online locations (in fact, you can even use marketing automation for in-store tracking but that’s a different post). This tracking happens similar to Google Analytics tracking just the basic information on each lead, what pages they visit and how long they stay for. Easy enough to understand. Marketing automation is the bridge you use to carry your potential leads safely to your CRM. Refining, setting speeds, organizing traffic, until finally each lead has been nurtured along the bridge safely into your CRM and ready to be your customer.  




#### Landing Pages

Next, your marketing automation software should let you create beautiful landing pages where you can collect more information from your leads. Read here for more information about [key things to consider when creating a landing page](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/landing-page/). These landing pages should live on your own domain and in your own website as this keeps the user flow consistent, bring a sense of familiarity and comfort that they have not been sent off to some third-party location. These landing pages typically contain a call-to-action, for example a form you want the visitor to fill out in order to download a specific PDF, or maybe [an infographic](https://www.mautic.org/blog/mautic-release-stats/) or slideshow. This is a key piece of the puzzle. You have to provide value to your leads. They are giving up personal information (be that an email address or social media handle), and you must give them something of value in return.   




#### Build Profiles

Once you have collected their information your marketing automation system will compile a comprehensive lead profile on each visitor. This is where things get exciting. Your lead profiles let you quickly see social media messages your visitor has posted, their public profiles, their history of interactions with your site and tons of other useful information.   




#### Drip Marketing Campaign

These known leads can now be added to specific drip marketing campaigns. We won’t go into the details of drip marketing here but you can read [this article to learn more about implementing and creating drip marketing campaigns and workflows](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/). Through these campaigns you will send relevant information to your leads and based on their responses take different actions as a result. But of course you don’t have to do this manually for each lead. Your marketing automation has these paths, decisions, and actions all defined ready to be executed either as a result of the lead’s actions or alternatively on a scheduled timeframe you specify (e.g. send this email 3 days after a successful form submission).   



**Are you starting to see what’s happening?** Marketing automation allows you to lead nurture your potential leads along the sales cycle without your direct involvement and time. Not only are you nurturing leads but you are generating new leads. And as these leads complete various actions (either through a campaign you’ve defined or simply through your website) you have the opportunity to assign points or a weight to each thing. Your leads are now being weighted for you based on the criteria you define.   




#### Convert Leads to Sales

The last step in this marketing automation workflow is to **convert these leads to customers**. As they have accrued points and built their profiles you can define triggers that will fire at various stages. Ultimately this is where your CRM will come back into the picture. When a lead reaches a specific level that you have determined to be your qualified lead level you can have your marketing automation system automatically send this lead into your CRM. And now you see something brilliant. Your CRM has now turned into a hub full of high-quality, ready to contact leads. You know they’re qualified because they have been nurtured along the sales cycle automatically through your marketing automation.   



Of course, you can also use marketing automation to stay in touch with existing customers. Keep your products and services in their minds and their inboxes using drip campaigns targeted specifically at those leads who are now existing customers. 

Marketing automation can save hundreds of hours for both your sales and your marketing teams. Lead management, lead nurturing, lead generation and customer management has never been easier. You’ll find you have more time to do the things you love and the quality of your personal contacts with leads will improve drastically. Don’t waste your time contacting every unqualified visitor to your website, use marketing automation to save time and improve your business.  

 


### Returning to the CRM

Your CRM will still play an important role in your organization, but it will now play the correct role. Don’t use it as a random catch-all for every lead and every cold call. Manage leads in marketing automation, create landing pages to collect more information, use drip marketing to nurture them and give them valuable information, and then, when they are qualified, send them to your CRM. Marketing automation and CRM work hand in hand. Use them both and use them well.', '<p>If you’re in the marketing sector you’re probably very familiar with the term and concept of marketing automation.

<p><strong>Are you starting to see what’s happening?</strong> Marketing automation allows you to lead nurture your potential leads along the sales cycle without your direct involvement and time. Not only are you nurturing leads but you are generating new leads. And as these leads complete various actions (either through a campaign you’ve defined or simply through your website) you have the opportunity to assign points or a weight to each thing. Your leads are now being weighted for you based on the criteria you define. </p>

<h4>Convert Leads to Sales</h4>
<p>The last step in this marketing automation workflow is to <strong>convert these leads to customers</strong>. As they have accrued points and built their profiles you can define triggers that will fire at various stages. Ultimately this is where your CRM will come back into the picture. When a lead reaches a specific level that you have determined to be your qualified lead level you can have your marketing automation system automatically send this lead into your CRM. And now you see something brilliant. Your CRM has now turned into a hub full of high-quality, ready to contact leads. You know they’re qualified because they have been nurtured along the sales cycle automatically through your marketing automation. </p>

<div class="alert alert-info">Of course, you can also use marketing automation to stay in touch with existing customers. Keep your products and services in their minds and their inboxes using drip campaigns targeted specifically at those leads who are now existing customers. </div>

<p>Marketing automation can save hundreds of hours for both your sales and your marketing teams. Lead management, lead nurturing, lead generation and customer management has never been easier. You’ll find you have more time to do the things you love and the quality of your personal contacts with leads will improve drastically. Don’t waste your time contacting every unqualified visitor to your website, use marketing automation to save time and improve your business.</p> 

<h3>Returning to the CRM</h3>
<p>Your CRM will still play an important role in your organization, but it will now play the correct role. Don’t use it as a random catch-all for every lead and every cold call. Manage leads in marketing automation, create landing pages to collect more information, use drip marketing to nurture them and give them valuable information, and then, when they are qualified, send them to your CRM. Marketing automation and CRM work hand in hand. Use them both and use them well.</p>', '2015-07-27 17:12:30', 1, '2015-07-27 17:12:30', '2015-07-27 17:15:22');

Yes, I was *(am)* a fighter, a warrior, a defender. You may also know that I am an analytical thinker, a data-driven developer, and a coding king. You do not think of me as a marketer. That’s fair, I don’t really think of myself as a marketer. It just ain’t my thing. But here I am and I have some cool things to share with you. You know it must be cool and it must be pretty great because it takes a lot for me to get outside of my comfort zone. So I hope you’ll listen and I am sure you’ll learn something as we look at why the topic of marketing automation is not scary.

If you’re like me then you probably need a good definition of what marketing automation even is before we can dig in deeper to why it’s not a scary idea. So here’s a working definition of marketing automation that we’ll use today as a base for what we discuss:

![Mautic is a marketing automation software platform](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/marketing_automation_scary.jpg)


Ok, so that’s a definition and, yeah it has some big words and maybe difficult to understand meaning. But that shouldn’t make it scary. The idea and practice of marketing automation is definitely **not scary**. In fact, let me tell you a story, I want to tell you about a time in my life that was scary. I want to tell you a war story.

I’d been in the military for several years. I’d even done a tour in Korea, now, I was back in the States and had just been told I would be deploying again. It was 2009 and I had just re-enlisted and requested Germany for my base. The unit I got assigned to greeted me with the news that we were being deployed, from Germany to Northern Afghanistan, an active combat zone in approximately 18 months. This was my first deployment to a fighting area and I was honestly a bit surprised it hadn’t happened sooner in my career considering when I joined. Because of this the actual thought of going wasn’t a big deal. But knowing that I was going to a combat zone and more specifically going to a country where exactly one year before a good friend of mine, Adam, had been stationed and subsequently lost his life in battle (Ironic right? Exactly a year to the day.) - well, that was more difficult.

Our unit was first to put boots on ground in this particular region because we were communications, and we had to get everything setup, there was 13 of us in the initial push, I was a newly appointed Sergeant and basically in charge of this group of first time deployments. This was less than half of a full platoon. We had to get the first round of communications up and running for everyone else that would be coming after us. And we had to do it with a skeleton crew. I’m talking about a lot of pressure here. But you want to know what worried me, or scared me the most? Of course you do! **The unknown**.

![The unknown marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the_unknown_marketing.jpg)


That’s right, it wasn’t so much the idea of a different country, or leading group of other newbies, or even being stationed in a combat zone. The most intimidating and somewhat terrifying part of the whole experience was what I didn’t know. That’s what’s truly scary. I’ll tell you more about that story in a little bit. I know you want to hear the end and how everything turned out, but let me get back to why I’m standing here in front of you and telling you one of my fears.

But I’m not alone in this type of fear. When I say the thing that worried me most was the unknown, this is actually quite common. I’m sure many of you here can think of sometime in your life when you were scared and the reason for your fear was not what you knew about a situation but what you didn’t know. I’m a big movie fan. So I’m going to use some quotes from different places when I think they are relevant. One of the greatest movie directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock is famous for this quote:

![no terror in the bang alfred hitchcock quote](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alfred_hitchcock_terror_band.jpg)


Pretty true right? I mean that’s the intimidating part. But here’s a better quote, this one from M. Night Shyamalan:

![Unknown Fears Marketing M Night](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mnight_quote_fear.jpg)


These directors are great. And you know what, for some reason the best movie directors always seem to understand how to build that suspense, and that terror. And I don’t even really like scary movies!

The unknown therefore is what is scary, the fear of the unknown is what keeps us from doing things; from accomplishing things.

So, when I say marketing automation is not scary I think you’ll probably agree. I’ve told you some stories from my life that are scary; and I’ve shared a few quotes about the root of fear. Now let’s turn our attention to our topic of marketing automation. If I want you to believe that this is not scary then I need to **remove the unknown**.

Let’s get to it! I want to give you a basic example of marketing automation, after that we’ll look quickly at a few common fears related specifically to marketing automation, and then lastly how you can get started.

Let’s look first at a basic example, we’ll call this **Michael’s Web Shop**, pretty creative name right? Hey, I never said I was creative. I said I was a coder so give me a break. Anyway Michael’s web shop builds websites, advanced components, plugins, and full applications for clients. *(Side note: I’ve got a degree in web design…hard to believe right? I guess they’ll give those things to anyone!)*

![marketing automation and unqualified leads definition](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unqualified_leads-300x224.jpg)
Ok, so Michael’s Web Shop works hard at finding new leads. We try to find leads but it’s difficult. We have a form on our website where people can fill out their information and we’ll contact them. We’ve tried Google Adwords, we go to events, we pass out cards, we cold call people. Everything we can think of to generate business. But we’re working too hard. We’re spending far too much time on unqualified leads. We need something that will help us spend our time more effectively. We need marketing automation. Here’s the really easy five steps we take to set it up.

 

## 5 Easy Steps to Marketing Automation


### ![tracking pixel marketing definition](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tracking_pixel.jpg)



### Step One: Add Tracking Pixel

The first thing we need to do is to add our tracking pixel to our website. This tracking pixel is provided by Mautic. Think of it like Google Analytics, most everyone here is familiar with Google’s tracking pixel and how it works*.* It’s not really an image, but code that returns an image (*after* it collects information).

Anyways, this tracking pixel needs to be included on every page of our website so it can track the movement of every website visitor we have. You can do this by putting the pixel in your template file. After we have the tracking pixel we move to the next piece, the landing page.

![Marketing Automation Landing Page](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the_landing_page.jpg)


### Step Two: Build a Landing Page

Here we want to create a landing page which we’ll use to funnel people to. Here’s the basic breakdown of a good landing page:

![Marketing automation call to action](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/call_to_action-300x224.jpg)
1. A strong, singular **call to action**.  This is usually a form. We’ll talk more about a form in the next step.

2. A **clutter-free design**. We want to make sure our landing page is not confusing and everyone who visits the page can easily understand what they are looking for and what they should do.

3. A **minimal (absent) menu**. Because this is a landing page where we want to keep the focus on our single call to action we want to minimize the likelihood that they will visit some other page and leave our landing page.

Ok, so that’s the second step, creating a great landing page, the third step is a big marketing piece. We want to actually learn more about our visitors. We want to create a form.

![Create a form in marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/create_a_form.jpg)


### Step Three: Create a Form

A form because we want to take those unknown leads (remember the visitors from the tracking pixel) and we want to collect more details about them. This is where the form is important. Too many fields and no one will want to fill it out, too few fields and we won’t get enough information. *See I told you, these marketing type people are kinda creepy*. But it makes sense, we want to collect information so we can continue to nurture and refine our leads before we contact them. This is where we get into the fourth step: building lead lists.

![Building lead lists in marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/building_lead_lists.jpg)


### Step Four: Building Lead Lists

Ok, man I am really getting deep into the world of marketing now. But oh well, no turning back at this point. Don’t hold this against me, remember I’m just an engineer. The next step we have to do here at Michael’s Web Shop is to define our lead lists. These are how we organize our leads into groups of people based on specific details of each lead. Lead lists can be built around the results of the form submissions or activity the user has taken. These lists can be created by hand, but remember, we want to save time so we want them to be built automatically. These lists serve a great purpose, because they’ll be used in our final step, sending emails.

![Email marketing and sending emails](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sending_emails.jpg)


### Step Five: Sending Emails

This last step in our process of implementing marketing automation is the part we will create and then rinse and repeat, over and over again. I like this part because it’s the most logical piece of the entire marketing mess. Here we create emails to send to our leads. We send these emails based on the lists they are on and the information they’ve given us. But this is all automated and all completely logic. It involves a very logical programming concept, if/then. Whew, now I’m starting to feel at home. These emails are created as part of a campaign.

![Campaigns in marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/definition_campaign-300x224.jpg)
Ok, so that’s what we’re talking about when we say marketing automation. We want to make things all happen automatically and based on pre-defined triggers. Then we can sit back and wait for qualified leads. How do we know a lead is qualified? Easy! They’ve completed your campaigns, they’ve opened your emails, they’ve filled out your forms, and they’ve continued to express interest in what you offer. (Yes, I said forms…you’ll want to create additional forms that collect different information on different landing pages…lots of little details all added together to build a lead profile).

And **that** is how Michael’s Web Shop creates a marketing automation process to save time, improve lead nurturing, and ultimately increase profitability. It’s not really that hard and now you see everything that’s involved. There are no real unknowns any more. We’ve looked at every piece and we’ve seen exactly how it works. See, no monsters under the bed…and nothing to be scared of.

## Three Common Fears

But just as in the movies, sometimes just knowing what’s involved does not mean every fear is removed. There are always questions and things that can be scary so let’s look quickly at a few common fears. We’ll look at three specific fears and then we’ll solve each of them.

[![First marketing automation fear](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first_fear_where_to_start.jpg)
](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first_fear_where_to_start.jpg)

First fear, the worry that you have **no idea where to start**. This is a very common first fear. Think about it, you’ve just learned about a new system, marketing automation, that you don’t know too much about, and remember the fear of theunknown? Well, now you know a little bit but you’re hesitant because you don’t know where you should begin. That’s completely ok. Here’s the solution: **Start with the basics**.

Nobody said you have to go jump into the deep-end of the pool. In fact, it’s probably better that you don’t. Not everyone grows up like me (down in Florida, living on a beach, always in the water). It’s usually best to start with the simple steps. One great way to do this is with very simple email marketing. *How many are familiar with MailChimp, or Constant Contact?* If you’ve used these tools then you know how to send a bulk email or a newsletter. This is a great way to get started. Don’t worry about everything that marketing automation can do. Just collect email addresses and setup a campaign that sends email. There’s nothing to it.

![Second marketing fear no skills](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/second_fear_no_skills.jpg)


Second fear, the worry that you **don’t have the skills to create landing pages**. Now I already shared with you that I have a degree in web design. Does that mean I can design web pages and successful landing pages? Um…probably not. Ask David, he’ll tell you, I should not be in charge of creating a landing page. But there is something I can do. I can use a pre-existing template. I can start with a framework already available and I can customize it easily enough. Seriously, give me Bootstrap, or some other starting point and I can make a page do what it needs to do…it might not be the prettiest, but it will work. So there’s the solution for this fear:** use existing resources**. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Build on things that have already been done.

![Third marketing fear creating campaigns](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/third_fear_create_campaign.jpg)


Third fear, the worry that you **can’t create a good campaign**. Ok, so this is probably the biggest thing for me personally. Cause if I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a dozen times….I am not a marketer. So given that I’m not really a marketing type of person how on earth am I supposed to create a great campaign, shoot, how am I supposed to even create a good campaign? This fear is a common one. Especially after we’ve looked at what marketing automation is, how to get started, and how to create pages. Now what?! What if I don’t do this right? What if I can’t get people to successfully complete my campaigns. This solution may be less formal but still easy to follow: **ask questions, read discussions, trial-and-error**.

Did you catch that? Trial and error! It’s ok to fail. It’s ok, as long as you learn from your mistakes. We all make mistakes (unless you’re me of course). But I’ve heard that everyone makes mistakes. So as long as you learn from the things that aren’t working and make improvements it’s ok. Every marketer is constantly improving their campaigns.

So you have no excuses, we’ve cleared up the unknown about what marketing automation is. We’ve looked at three common fears and how to solve them. Simply put, you have no more excuses. You have to get started.

![Alfred Hitchcock Scariest Moment Starting](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hitchcock_scariest_moment.jpg)


Stephen King, the wise sage of scary movies. What a great quote. I honestly don’t know if he’s a great director or just a creepy dude with a sick and twisted outlook on life. Either way, this quote is perfect because it’s true. It is scary right before you start. When I was landing in northern Afghanistan, unsure about what lay ahead of me, this was a scary moment. If you haven’t ever been in that situation you probably can’t even imagine that feeling. Trust me, it’s not a fun experience. But together we can conquer this fear.

![How to start with marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_1.jpg)


So let’s look now at **how to start**. We’re going to break this down into three easy steps. See just saying three easy steps, already it feels like this will be simple! Ok, let’s dive in.

![Starting Marketing Automation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_one.jpg)
The first step to getting started is simply to: **Identify a Purpose**. Before we can start creating our campaigns, crafting our emails, or even building our forms we have to start with what we want to accomplish. What is our purpose for all of this? And no, making more money doesn’t count. Of course we all want more money…if you say you don’t….well, I don’t believe you. Dig deeper. What is your purpose for what you do? What are the problems you want to solve? What does your ideal client look like? You gotta start here. Start with the purpose you want to accomplish because once you know your goal you can create a plan to get there.

![Create a marketing automation plan](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_2.jpg)
And that brings us quickly to the second step: **Create a Plan**. Once you know your purpose you can then work out a plan to accomplish that purpose. You can create a series of steps to get to your goal. Simple, easy-to-measure steps. Your plan should take an unknown lead into a known lead and a qualified potential customer. This means, from a first point of contact all the way through to someone who is ready to buy what you’re selling. Your plan is important because from this plan you can then build your basic setup.

**[![Basic marketing automation setup](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_3.jpg)
](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_3.jpg)Building Your Basic Setup** is the combination of all the the features of your marketing process. This is where you finally get into setting things up in your marketing automation tool. Remember, you’ve already identified your purpose and created your plan, so now it’s simply building the pieces that relate to that plan. We went through a basic example before with Michael’s Web Shop, so you already have a bit of an idea what all is involved. Here’s a few more specifics just to get you started. *Why do I keep getting suckered into this kind of thing?*

## Basic Marketing Automation Setup

[gallery link="none" columns="2" size="large" type="slideshow" ids="694,693,692,691"]

Ok, here’s what you need to do: **Create Your Lead Fields** - these lead fields are the unique aspects of your leads you want to collect. This is how you make your leads relevant to your particular business. Next, **Create A List** - this list is where you organize your leads, maybe based on the lead fields you just created, maybe based on other characteristics. **Create A Form** - Now that you know what you want to collect from your leads and how you are organizing them, you need to build a form to collect this information…remember, you might not want to collect all of it at once. Build a couple forms and use them at different places and different times. Now you’re ready to **Create Emails** - Here you want to have automated email that will be sent to your leads and provide them with good information. They may be interested in learning more about what you do, they may be interested in a particular subject or topic. These emails are just your way of staying in touch with them and being available. Don’t be obnoxious (yeah, we all know those marketing people that are just way way too obnoxious). Be helpful. Be timely. But please don’t be a nuisance. I’m warning you. Ok, I’ve done your basic setup building for you. But it’s up to you to make it personal and specific to your business. *No, I’m not doing that for you too…c’mon you gotta do something here!*

![Stephen King Be Brave Quote](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/stephen_king_be_brave.jpg)


Ok, now we’re here at an incredible JoomlaDay event, I mean seriously, I go to bunches of events, I speak at bunches of events *(seriously don’t get why they keep inviting me back!)* But anyways, since we’re here at a Joomla event you would probably like to see how you can tie in your marketing automation with Joomla. This is kinda cool. Mautic has a plugin available specifically for Joomla. See, I can’t help myself - I just keep making your life easy. What does this plugin do? Well I’m glad you asked. This little bit of code does cool stuff, it will automatically add the tracking pixel to your website, and maybe more importantly it will let you dynamically inject a form from your marketing automation directly into your Joomla content.

All you have to do is drop a shortcode in place: **{mauticform ID}** - see that’s all you have to do. Crazy simple. Put that code into any content item and Mautic will automatically replace it with the form fields themselves. That is as easy as it gets. Now your marketing automation exists directly within your Joomla website. Any page on your site can be a landing page. I told you it was cool.

Now we’ve been through conquering the fear of the unknown, we’ve looked at how to get started and even more specifically how you can get started in Joomla, the most powerful CMS in the world. **There is nothing left to do now but grow**. Take the knowledge you now hold and apply it. I like to say rinse and repeat, because that’s all it is. You’re doing the same thing again but refined and improved based on your experiences. As you grow you become better and more proficient at identifying what works best for your business. Growing is not scary. Growing is exciting. This is where you take your knowledge and become an expert. It takes time, and it doesn’t happen overnight. Don’t be afraid to grow. Be confident.

## Concluding My Story

That brings me back to my army story I started sharing earlier. Obviously I’m standing here in front of you, I made it home safely. I overcame my fears. I landed in northern Afghanistan and immediately began working on my tasks. I started small, checking the shipments to make sure we had everything we needed to do our job. See, that’s an easy task. I knew what needed to be done and I started small. Then, the next thing done was to work through building out the com’s, designing the systems, overseeing the work of the other troops I was in command of, I was designing a plan and a process. Then, I began the task of organizing information. And slowly the fears subsided. I’d be crazy to say I wasn’t still concerned…any time you’re in a combat zone you’re going to be on high alert, no matter what you do. But it’s manageable. I overcame my fears and finally when my unit was recalled I left with a sense of accomplishment, I could relax, and I could enjoy myself.

You can do the same. No, you’re not in a combat zone like I was. No, you don’t have the same circumstances or burdens weighing down on you, and you fears are different…but they are still very real. Your fears, though different, are no less important. Marketing and marketing automation though should not be one of those fears. After what you’ve heard today I am sure you will feel much more equipped and prepared to face the unknown, to dispel the fear and to achieve great things in your businesses.

I’ll leave you with one last quote from a recent movie, no I haven’t seen this one, but there’s a movie called **Inside Out**, in this animated film we are given a front row seat to the emotions of a little girl. One of those emotions is fear. After one particularly difficult experience fear speaks up and gives the following line which I think is the perfect ending to my talk here today:

![InsideOut Fear Success Quote](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fear_inside_out_success.jpg)', 'Most of you know me already, my name is Michael Babker, and <strong>I’m a fighter</strong>. That sounded a bit like I was starting an AA meeting. But if you do know me then you know that’s not a confession. It’s a statement of fact. Now I know some of you are laughing because you know I have a somewhat opinionated view on things. And you think when I say I’m a fighter you’re thinking about that aspect of my personality, but you know what I’m referring to, my past as a fighter in the United States Army. It was a refining part of my past and for those of you that maybe don’t know me, you soon will.

Yes, I was <em>(am)</em> a fighter, a warrior, a defender. You may also know that I am an analytical thinker, a data-driven developer, and a coding king. You do not think of me as a marketer. That’s fair, I don’t really think of myself as a marketer. It just ain’t my thing. But here I am and I have some cool things to share with you. You know it must be cool and it must be pretty great because it takes a lot for me to get outside of my comfort zone. So I hope you’ll listen and I am sure you’ll learn something as we look at why the topic of marketing automation is not scary.

If you’re like me then you probably need a good definition of what marketing automation even is before we can dig in deeper to why it’s not a scary idea. So here’s a working definition of marketing automation that we’ll use today as a base for what we discuss:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-669 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/marketing_automation_scary.jpg" alt="Mautic is a marketing automation software platform" />

Ok, so that’s a definition and, yeah it has some big words and maybe difficult to understand meaning. But that shouldn’t make it scary. The idea and practice of marketing automation is definitely <strong>not scary</strong>. In fact, let me tell you a story, I want to tell you about a time in my life that was scary. I want to tell you a war story.

I’d been in the military for several years. I’d even done a tour in Korea, now, I was back in the States and had just been told I would be deploying again. It was 2009 and I had just re-enlisted and requested Germany for my base. The unit I got assigned to greeted me with the news that we were being deployed, from Germany to Northern Afghanistan, an active combat zone in approximately 18 months. This was my first deployment to a fighting area and I was honestly a bit surprised it hadn’t happened sooner in my career considering when I joined. Because of this the actual thought of going wasn’t a big deal. But knowing that I was going to a combat zone and more specifically going to a country where exactly one year before a good friend of mine, Adam, had been stationed and subsequently lost his life in battle (Ironic right? Exactly a year to the day.) - well, that was more difficult.

Our unit was first to put boots on ground in this particular region because we were communications, and we had to get everything setup, there was 13 of us in the initial push, I was a newly appointed Sergeant and basically in charge of this group of first time deployments. This was less than half of a full platoon. We had to get the first round of communications up and running for everyone else that would be coming after us. And we had to do it with a skeleton crew. I’m talking about a lot of pressure here. But you want to know what worried me, or scared me the most? Of course you do! <strong>The unknown</strong>.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-670 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the_unknown_marketing.jpg" alt="The unknown marketing automation" width="1020" height="760" />

That’s right, it wasn’t so much the idea of a different country, or leading group of other newbies, or even being stationed in a combat zone. The most intimidating and somewhat terrifying part of the whole experience was what I didn’t know. That’s what’s truly scary. I’ll tell you more about that story in a little bit. I know you want to hear the end and how everything turned out, but let me get back to why I’m standing here in front of you and telling you one of my fears.

But I’m not alone in this type of fear. When I say the thing that worried me most was the unknown, this is actually quite common. I’m sure many of you here can think of sometime in your life when you were scared and the reason for your fear was not what you knew about a situation but what you didn’t know. I’m a big movie fan. So I’m going to use some quotes from different places when I think they are relevant. One of the greatest movie directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock is famous for this quote:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-671 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/alfred_hitchcock_terror_band.jpg" alt="no terror in the bang alfred hitchcock quote" width="1020" height="760" />

Pretty true right? I mean that’s the intimidating part. But here’s a better quote, this one from M. Night Shyamalan:

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-672 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/mnight_quote_fear.jpg" alt="Unknown Fears Marketing M Night" width="1020" height="760" />

These directors are great. And you know what, for some reason the best movie directors always seem to understand how to build that suspense, and that terror. And I don’t even really like scary movies!

The unknown therefore is what is scary, the fear of the unknown is what keeps us from doing things; from accomplishing things.

So, when I say marketing automation is not scary I think you’ll probably agree. I’ve told you some stories from my life that are scary; and I’ve shared a few quotes about the root of fear. Now let’s turn our attention to our topic of marketing automation. If I want you to believe that this is not scary then I need to <strong>remove the unknown</strong>.

Let’s get to it! I want to give you a basic example of marketing automation, after that we’ll look quickly at a few common fears related specifically to marketing automation, and then lastly how you can get started.

Let’s look first at a basic example, we’ll call this <strong>Michael’s Web Shop</strong>, pretty creative name right? Hey, I never said I was creative. I said I was a coder so give me a break. Anyway Michael’s web shop builds websites, advanced components, plugins, and full applications for clients. <em>(Side note: I’ve got a degree in web design…hard to believe right? I guess they’ll give those things to anyone!)</em>

<img class="thumbnail size-full wp-image-673 alignright" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/unqualified_leads-300x224.jpg" alt="marketing automation and unqualified leads definition" />Ok, so Michael’s Web Shop works hard at finding new leads. We try to find leads but it’s difficult. We have a form on our website where people can fill out their information and we’ll contact them. We’ve tried Google Adwords, we go to events, we pass out cards, we cold call people. Everything we can think of to generate business. But we’re working too hard. We’re spending far too much time on unqualified leads. We need something that will help us spend our time more effectively. We need marketing automation. Here’s the really easy five steps we take to set it up.

&nbsp;
<h2>5 Easy Steps to Marketing Automation</h2>
<h3><img class="aligncenter wp-image-674 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/tracking_pixel.jpg" alt="tracking pixel marketing definition" width="1020" height="760" /></h3>
<h3>Step One: Add Tracking Pixel</h3>
The first thing we need to do is to add our tracking pixel to our website. This tracking pixel is provided by Mautic. Think of it like Google Analytics, most everyone here is familiar with Google’s tracking pixel and how it works<i>.</i> It’s not really an image, but code that returns an image (<em>after</em> it collects information).

Anyways, this tracking pixel needs to be included on every page of our website so it can track the movement of every website visitor we have. You can do this by putting the pixel in your template file. After we have the tracking pixel we move to the next piece, the landing page.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-675 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/the_landing_page.jpg" alt="Marketing Automation Landing Page" width="1020" height="760" />
<h3>Step Two: Build a Landing Page</h3>
Here we want to create a landing page which we’ll use to funnel people to. Here’s the basic breakdown of a good landing page:

<img class="thumbnail size-medium wp-image-676 alignright" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/call_to_action-300x224.jpg" alt="Marketing automation call to action" />1. A strong, singular <strong>call to action</strong>.  This is usually a form. We’ll talk more about a form in the next step.

2. A <strong>clutter-free design</strong>. We want to make sure our landing page is not confusing and everyone who visits the page can easily understand what they are looking for and what they should do.

3. A <strong>minimal (absent) menu</strong>. Because this is a landing page where we want to keep the focus on our single call to action we want to minimize the likelihood that they will visit some other page and leave our landing page.

Ok, so that’s the second step, creating a great landing page, the third step is a big marketing piece. We want to actually learn more about our visitors. We want to create a form.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-677 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/create_a_form.jpg" alt="Create a form in marketing automation" width="1020" height="760" />
<h3>Step Three: Create a Form</h3>
A form because we want to take those unknown leads (remember the visitors from the tracking pixel) and we want to collect more details about them. This is where the form is important. Too many fields and no one will want to fill it out, too few fields and we won’t get enough information. <em>See I told you, these marketing type people are kinda creepy</em>. But it makes sense, we want to collect information so we can continue to nurture and refine our leads before we contact them. This is where we get into the fourth step: building lead lists.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-678 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/building_lead_lists.jpg" alt="Building lead lists in marketing automation" width="1020" height="760" />
<h3>Step Four: Building Lead Lists</h3>
Ok, man I am really getting deep into the world of marketing now. But oh well, no turning back at this point. Don’t hold this against me, remember I’m just an engineer. The next step we have to do here at Michael’s Web Shop is to define our lead lists. These are how we organize our leads into groups of people based on specific details of each lead. Lead lists can be built around the results of the form submissions or activity the user has taken. These lists can be created by hand, but remember, we want to save time so we want them to be built automatically. These lists serve a great purpose, because they’ll be used in our final step, sending emails.

<img class="aligncenter wp-image-679 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sending_emails.jpg" alt="Email marketing and sending emails" width="1020" height="760" />
<h3>Step Five: Sending Emails</h3>
This last step in our process of implementing marketing automation is the part we will create and then rinse and repeat, over and over again. I like this part because it’s the most logical piece of the entire marketing mess. Here we create emails to send to our leads. We send these emails based on the lists they are on and the information they’ve given us. But this is all automated and all completely logic. It involves a very logical programming concept, if/then. Whew, now I’m starting to feel at home. These emails are created as part of a campaign.

<img class="thumbnail size-medium wp-image-680 alignright" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/definition_campaign-300x224.jpg" alt="Campaigns in marketing automation" />Ok, so that’s what we’re talking about when we say marketing automation. We want to make things all happen automatically and based on pre-defined triggers. Then we can sit back and wait for qualified leads. How do we know a lead is qualified? Easy! They’ve completed your campaigns, they’ve opened your emails, they’ve filled out your forms, and they’ve continued to express interest in what you offer. (Yes, I said forms…you’ll want to create additional forms that collect different information on different landing pages…lots of little details all added together to build a lead profile).

And <strong>that</strong> is how Michael’s Web Shop creates a marketing automation process to save time, improve lead nurturing, and ultimately increase profitability. It’s not really that hard and now you see everything that’s involved. There are no real unknowns any more. We’ve looked at every piece and we’ve seen exactly how it works. See, no monsters under the bed…and nothing to be scared of.
<h2>Three Common Fears</h2>
But just as in the movies, sometimes just knowing what’s involved does not mean every fear is removed. There are always questions and things that can be scary so let’s look quickly at a few common fears. We’ll look at three specific fears and then we’ll solve each of them.

<a href="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first_fear_where_to_start.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-681" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/first_fear_where_to_start.jpg" alt="First marketing automation fear" width="1020" height="760" /></a>

First fear, the worry that you have <strong>no idea where to start</strong>. This is a very common first fear. Think about it, you’ve just learned about a new system, marketing automation, that you don’t know too much about, and remember the fear of theunknown? Well, now you know a little bit but you’re hesitant because you don’t know where you should begin. That’s completely ok. Here’s the solution: <strong>Start with the basics</strong>.

Nobody said you have to go jump into the deep-end of the pool. In fact, it’s probably better that you don’t. Not everyone grows up like me (down in Florida, living on a beach, always in the water). It’s usually best to start with the simple steps. One great way to do this is with very simple email marketing. <em>How many are familiar with MailChimp, or Constant Contact?</em> If you’ve used these tools then you know how to send a bulk email or a newsletter. This is a great way to get started. Don’t worry about everything that marketing automation can do. Just collect email addresses and setup a campaign that sends email. There’s nothing to it.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-687" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/second_fear_no_skills.jpg" alt="Second marketing fear no skills" width="1020" height="760" />

Second fear, the worry that you <strong>don’t have the skills to create landing pages</strong>. Now I already shared with you that I have a degree in web design. Does that mean I can design web pages and successful landing pages? Um…probably not. Ask David, he’ll tell you, I should not be in charge of creating a landing page. But there is something I can do. I can use a pre-existing template. I can start with a framework already available and I can customize it easily enough. Seriously, give me Bootstrap, or some other starting point and I can make a page do what it needs to do…it might not be the prettiest, but it will work. So there’s the solution for this fear:<strong> use existing resources</strong>. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Build on things that have already been done.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-688" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/third_fear_create_campaign.jpg" alt="Third marketing fear creating campaigns" width="1020" height="760" />

Third fear, the worry that you <strong>can’t create a good campaign</strong>. Ok, so this is probably the biggest thing for me personally. Cause if I’ve said it once, I’ve said it a dozen times….I am not a marketer. So given that I’m not really a marketing type of person how on earth am I supposed to create a great campaign, shoot, how am I supposed to even create a good campaign? This fear is a common one. Especially after we’ve looked at what marketing automation is, how to get started, and how to create pages. Now what?! What if I don’t do this right? What if I can’t get people to successfully complete my campaigns. This solution may be less formal but still easy to follow: <strong>ask questions, read discussions, trial-and-error</strong>.

Did you catch that? Trial and error! It’s ok to fail. It’s ok, as long as you learn from your mistakes. We all make mistakes (unless you’re me of course). But I’ve heard that everyone makes mistakes. So as long as you learn from the things that aren’t working and make improvements it’s ok. Every marketer is constantly improving their campaigns.

So you have no excuses, we’ve cleared up the unknown about what marketing automation is. We’ve looked at three common fears and how to solve them. Simply put, you have no more excuses. You have to get started.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-689" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/hitchcock_scariest_moment.jpg" alt="Alfred Hitchcock Scariest Moment Starting" width="1020" height="760" />

Stephen King, the wise sage of scary movies. What a great quote. I honestly don’t know if he’s a great director or just a creepy dude with a sick and twisted outlook on life. Either way, this quote is perfect because it’s true. It is scary right before you start. When I was landing in northern Afghanistan, unsure about what lay ahead of me, this was a scary moment. If you haven’t ever been in that situation you probably can’t even imagine that feeling. Trust me, it’s not a fun experience. But together we can conquer this fear.

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-698" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_1.jpg" alt="How to start with marketing automation" width="1020" height="760" />

So let’s look now at <strong>how to start</strong>. We’re going to break this down into three easy steps. See just saying three easy steps, already it feels like this will be simple! Ok, let’s dive in.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-697 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_one.jpg" alt="Starting Marketing Automation" width="1020" height="760" />The first step to getting started is simply to: <strong>Identify a Purpose</strong>. Before we can start creating our campaigns, crafting our emails, or even building our forms we have to start with what we want to accomplish. What is our purpose for all of this? And no, making more money doesn’t count. Of course we all want more money…if you say you don’t….well, I don’t believe you. Dig deeper. What is your purpose for what you do? What are the problems you want to solve? What does your ideal client look like? You gotta start here. Start with the purpose you want to accomplish because once you know your goal you can create a plan to get there.

<img class="alignnone wp-image-696 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_2.jpg" alt="Create a marketing automation plan" width="1020" height="760" />And that brings us quickly to the second step: <strong>Create a Plan</strong>. Once you know your purpose you can then work out a plan to accomplish that purpose. You can create a series of steps to get to your goal. Simple, easy-to-measure steps. Your plan should take an unknown lead into a known lead and a qualified potential customer. This means, from a first point of contact all the way through to someone who is ready to buy what you’re selling. Your plan is important because from this plan you can then build your basic setup.

<strong><a href="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_3.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-695 size-full" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/how_to_start_step_3.jpg" alt="Basic marketing automation setup" width="1020" height="760" /></a>Building Your Basic Setup</strong> is the combination of all the the features of your marketing process. This is where you finally get into setting things up in your marketing automation tool. Remember, you’ve already identified your purpose and created your plan, so now it’s simply building the pieces that relate to that plan. We went through a basic example before with Michael’s Web Shop, so you already have a bit of an idea what all is involved. Here’s a few more specifics just to get you started. <em>Why do I keep getting suckered into this kind of thing?</em>
<h2>Basic Marketing Automation Setup</h2>
[gallery link="none" columns="2" size="large" type="slideshow" ids="694,693,692,691"]

Ok, here’s what you need to do: <strong>Create Your Lead Fields</strong> - these lead fields are the unique aspects of your leads you want to collect. This is how you make your leads relevant to your particular business. Next, <strong>Create A List</strong> - this list is where you organize your leads, maybe based on the lead fields you just created, maybe based on other characteristics. <strong>Create A Form</strong> - Now that you know what you want to collect from your leads and how you are organizing them, you need to build a form to collect this information…remember, you might not want to collect all of it at once. Build a couple forms and use them at different places and different times. Now you’re ready to <strong>Create Emails</strong> - Here you want to have automated email that will be sent to your leads and provide them with good information. They may be interested in learning more about what you do, they may be interested in a particular subject or topic. These emails are just your way of staying in touch with them and being available. Don’t be obnoxious (yeah, we all know those marketing people that are just way way too obnoxious). Be helpful. Be timely. But please don’t be a nuisance. I’m warning you. Ok, I’ve done your basic setup building for you. But it’s up to you to make it personal and specific to your business. <em>No, I’m not doing that for you too…c’mon you gotta do something here!</em>

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-690" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/stephen_king_be_brave.jpg" alt="Stephen King Be Brave Quote" width="1020" height="760" />

Ok, now we’re here at an incredible JoomlaDay event, I mean seriously, I go to bunches of events, I speak at bunches of events <em>(seriously don’t get why they keep inviting me back!)</em> But anyways, since we’re here at a Joomla event you would probably like to see how you can tie in your marketing automation with Joomla. This is kinda cool. Mautic has a plugin available specifically for Joomla. See, I can’t help myself - I just keep making your life easy. What does this plugin do? Well I’m glad you asked. This little bit of code does cool stuff, it will automatically add the tracking pixel to your website, and maybe more importantly it will let you dynamically inject a form from your marketing automation directly into your Joomla content.

All you have to do is drop a shortcode in place: <strong>{mauticform ID}</strong> - see that’s all you have to do. Crazy simple. Put that code into any content item and Mautic will automatically replace it with the form fields themselves. That is as easy as it gets. Now your marketing automation exists directly within your Joomla website. Any page on your site can be a landing page. I told you it was cool.

Now we’ve been through conquering the fear of the unknown, we’ve looked at how to get started and even more specifically how you can get started in Joomla, the most powerful CMS in the world. <strong>There is nothing left to do now but grow</strong>. Take the knowledge you now hold and apply it. I like to say rinse and repeat, because that’s all it is. You’re doing the same thing again but refined and improved based on your experiences. As you grow you become better and more proficient at identifying what works best for your business. Growing is not scary. Growing is exciting. This is where you take your knowledge and become an expert. It takes time, and it doesn’t happen overnight. Don’t be afraid to grow. Be confident.
<h2>Concluding My Story</h2>
That brings me back to my army story I started sharing earlier. Obviously I’m standing here in front of you, I made it home safely. I overcame my fears. I landed in northern Afghanistan and immediately began working on my tasks. I started small, checking the shipments to make sure we had everything we needed to do our job. See, that’s an easy task. I knew what needed to be done and I started small. Then, the next thing done was to work through building out the com’s, designing the systems, overseeing the work of the other troops I was in command of, I was designing a plan and a process. Then, I began the task of organizing information. And slowly the fears subsided. I’d be crazy to say I wasn’t still concerned…any time you’re in a combat zone you’re going to be on high alert, no matter what you do. But it’s manageable. I overcame my fears and finally when my unit was recalled I left with a sense of accomplishment, I could relax, and I could enjoy myself.

You can do the same. No, you’re not in a combat zone like I was. No, you don’t have the same circumstances or burdens weighing down on you, and you fears are different…but they are still very real. Your fears, though different, are no less important. Marketing and marketing automation though should not be one of those fears. After what you’ve heard today I am sure you will feel much more equipped and prepared to face the unknown, to dispel the fear and to achieve great things in your businesses.

I’ll leave you with one last quote from a recent movie, no I haven’t seen this one, but there’s a movie called <strong>Inside Out</strong>, in this animated film we are given a front row seat to the emotions of a little girl. One of those emotions is fear. After one particularly difficult experience fear speaks up and gives the following line which I think is the perfect ending to my talk here today:

Everyone does not open or read every email they get. These are two very well-known “facts” you can count on. I’m sure if you’re anything like me you get hundreds of emails a day; and no matter how much I’d like to open and read each one it’s simply not humanly possible. What does this mean? Well it means some emails get filed before I ever see them, and other emails get a quick glance at the headline and nothing more. That’s just the cold hard truth of email inboxes. And I’m sure your email is similar. So here’s my question for you. Do you think about this when you are writing your emails? You’re engaging in b2b email marketing and you’re working hard to get maximum opens. Are you thinking about your email marketing strategy?

Your readers have inboxes just like you. They have rules, labels, and spam filters just like you do. Here are 5 best tips for writing emails. I won''t guarantee that you’ll see 100% open rates on your email as a result of these 5 tips but they are a great starting point.

### 1. Be Short

You don’t have to write a novel when composing an email. Think about the emails you like to receive when they are short and to the point you can very quickly skim the contents and determine the importance of the letter. When you’re writing your emails to your audience keep this in mind. They want to be able to read it quickly. Don’t reveal too much information (we’ll talk more about this later).

### 2. Be Specific

There’s nothing worse than trying to guess at the purpose of an email. If you don’t understand why the email has been sent you’re unlikely to read it or take any action as a result. Create your emails with purpose. Identify a handful (at most) of items you want to share and give a clear specific action you want the reader to take. (e.g. Click this link to read this article! or maybe Leave a comment here)

### 3. Be Consistent

Don’t share conflicting information. You don’t want to appear dishonest in your communication and you don’t want to say one thing in your email and another on your website. This is especially true with b2b email marketing where all your emails are tied to a corporate or business website. You have to make sure you are consistent, in your voice, your tone, and your content. Consistency encourages trust.

### 4. Be Relevant

Ok, another personal story. I get emails every day on all types of things: products, services, and more. Some of them are completely and totally irrelevant to me. (No, I don’t need to volume pricing on air conditioning units.) You should be using your marketing automation software to make your b2b email marketing effective and relevant. You do this by correctly building your lead lists, and your lead profiles. Managing your leads correctly will let you target them with relevant information in your emails.

### 5. Be Interesting

The last tip for writing better b2b emails is a simple one, in fact it’s almost more of a personal plea. Please be interesting! Your readers will appreciate your emails so much more if they are witty, entertaining, and interesting instead of just another boring, drab regurgitation of information. This is a harder concept in b2b email marketing since the topics are more business oriented, but if you have correctly identified your voice you can always fine ways to be interesting.

These are **my** best 5 tips for better b2b email marketing. I’m sure there are more that are good and I’m sure you also have some that you have found to be important when formulating your b2b email marketing campaigns and implementing a strategy for email success.

Everyone does not open or read every email they get. These are two very well-known “facts” you can count on. I’m sure if you’re anything like me you get hundreds of emails a day; and no matter how much I’d like to open and read each one it’s simply not humanly possible. What does this mean? Well it means some emails get filed before I ever see them, and other emails get a quick glance at the headline and nothing more. That’s just the cold hard truth of email inboxes. And I’m sure your email is similar. So here’s my question for you. Do you think about this when you are writing your emails? You’re engaging in b2b email marketing and you’re working hard to get maximum opens. Are you thinking about your email marketing strategy?

When you create a form to collect user information you are populating your lead automation system with the details you need to effectively market to your target audience. If these lead forms are the main way to gather information then you need to focus on specifically on a simple form that is easy to create and submit. Here are some suggestions on how to create a lead form that converts.

### Create Simple Forms

Your forms should be simple in nature. Don’t try to ask your user to fill out a 5 page form with a dozen fields on each page. Be smart about the information you want to collect and only ask for the pieces of info you really need. You may want to break it up into multiple forms if you have a lot of information you want. If you do this consider the possibility of sending the user to different forms at different times to keep the task from feeling overwhelming. **Your lead forms should be quick and easy to fill out**.

### Create Beautiful Forms

You’ve heard that first impressions are important when meeting someone new. Well, this same philosophy holds true when talking about your website and your landing pages. Your landing pages are your first impression for your new site visitors. Your forms are the first interaction these visitors may have with you. You need to focus on keeping them simple, clean, and beautiful. Pay attention to your CSS and your use of images. Consider your site visitors when building your forms: Are they using a mobile device or a desktop? Are they on a fast internet connection or a cellular network? All of these things affect how beautiful your form is. **Your website forms need to be optimized for speed, clarity, and readability.**

### Create Clear Form Button Names

There have been numerous studies and tests on form submissions based purely on the call-to-action button text. This text needs to be compelling but not pushy. You want to encourage the user to submit but not be in their face about it. The good news is you don’t have to panic about your button text. **Sometimes the simplest wording is also the best.** For example, “get” has proven to be highly effective for call-to-action buttons text. Keep your statements short and simple, don’t go over a dozen words (remember this is a button). If you''re interested in learning more here''s [one article on button text and cta''s](http://conversionxl.com/everything-cta-size-location-color-works/).

### Pick Your Title Carefully

When you name your form (or title for your landing page) you want to use this opportunity to create a compelling story for your visitor. You should not be creating your forms and your landing pages just for a search engine. Remember that you’re working with people and human emotions and reactions. You want to target their interests and their behavior with your titles. Craft a title that speaks to people. This form title is the most read copy on your page and you should use your title to create an interest and a motivation to complete the form. What are you offering them as a result of their form submission? What is the value you are giving to them? **Choose your words carefully and tell a story with your title. **

### A/B Test Forms

Lastly, you should always A/B test your forms. This means creating two very similar versions of the same form and sending your users randomly to one of them. There is no perfect environment for A/B testing and there are some who would disagree with the value of creating these tests, however, while these tests may not provide immense value in fine-tuning a form they can be great help when massively overhauling a form design and layout. Don’t neglect the importance of reworking your forms based on user feedback, submissions, or interactions. Your lead forms should not be created once and then neglected or left alone. **Always be looking for ways to improve your forms.** Once you''ve found a lead form that works you should begin implementing small, incremental adjustments.

When you create your lead forms you want to keep this idea in mind: **You are asking for trust from your user**. You are asking them for information. You want them to give you something. When you do this you need to show them why they should feel safe to give you this information. You should make your landing pages, and your forms trustworthy and valuable. Give something to your visitors. Be open and honest. Your button text, your form title, and your form design all help make you more trustworthy.

The answer is to **create a double opt-in email list**.

### Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of a double opt-in email campaign:

The Sign Up (yellow) lead source is simply our form created in step 4. Any lead who submits the form will be automatically added to the campaign.

![lead source signup for emails](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lead_source.png)


Add to pending is a "Modify lead''s lists" action that will immediately add the lead to the Pending lead list created in step 1.

![Email marketing add lead to list](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/add_to_pending.png)


Send in Opt-in Email is a "Send Email" action selecting the email created in step 3.

![Senc email to confirm opt-in to list](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/send_email.png)


Add a "Visits a page" decision and choose the landing page created in step 2 then connect the bottom of the "Send email" action into the top of the "Visits a page" decision.

![Double opt-in visits landing page](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/visits_a_page.png)


And finally, add another "Modify lead''s lists" and choose to remove the lead from the Pending and add to the Confirmed list. Connect the bottom green anchor, or the direct action decision path, of the "Visits a page" decision to the top of the newly created "Modify lead''s list" action.

A new feature coming soon to a future release of Mautic is one that we know will be extremely exciting. The **Mautic Marketplace** will allow everyone to share their plugins, themes, workflows, campaign templates and more. In preparation for this upcoming feature we’ll be creating a series of articles related to the development of a Mautic plugin to help you as you look to create your first Mautic plugin.

I’ll be covering how to **create a Mautic plugin from start to finish** in a series of posts that I hope will bring clarity and understanding to the entire process and answer any questions that arise during the process. If you get stuck I encourage you to jump into the forum to ask your questions and help others too!

Before we begin let’s look quickly at what a plugin is and why we care about creating them. With this idea of plugins Mautic functions very similar to something like WordPress. Plugins allow you to do a number of things from integrating other software systems and software tools to modifying the functionality of Mautic. **Plugins let you extend Mautic however you need.** This is one of the greatest benefits of an open source marketing platform like Mautic. You have full access to view the source code, examine existing plugins and improve the core by suggesting additional triggers or listener events.

> Want a concrete example? A Mautic plugin might let you push data from a lead to an external CRM system. The plugin will listen for a specific action and when that action occurs will trigger an event that pushes data to some other system. Here’s a second example: A Mautic plugin might modify all your landing page URL’s and other external URL’s to use a link-shortening system (like Bitly) before they are rendered and displayed to the end user.

Ok, so that’s an idea of what a plugin might do and a couple of examples of how they might be used. I think that’s enough background. Let’s start planning what our sample plugin will do that we’re going to create together.

## Step 1: Plan Your Plugin


### Purpose of the Plugin

I want to create a plugin that pushes some information from Mautic to an external service. I have decided for the purpose of this tutorial series that I want to create a plugin that will let me create a form within Mautic and push the results of that form to Desk.com, a ticketing system.

At a high-level review, I am looking to create a plugin that will let me use Mautic to push support tickets into my support system but use Mautic for form collection and submission. By doing this I will be able to do a few different things. First, this will let me demonstrate how to create a plugin that needs additional configuration fields defined. Second, this plugin will add a new form action to standalone forms that will allow me to push my form submissions to some other system via an API. Third, this plugin will give me the opportunity to write a couple different listeners. And lastly, I can show some advanced techniques for field mapping.

### Outline Basic Plugin Structure

Now that we have identified the purpose of our plugin this will help me to outline the basic plugin structure I want to use. Here is my basic plugin structure:

![Create mautic plugin file structure](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mautic_desk_plugin_files.png)


*Don’t panic we’re going to look in-depth at each folder and file here through the course of this tutorial but for now we’ll just glance briefly at just a few highlights that are important to note.*

**Form Folder:** Because I am creating a plugin that will provide additional features (fields) on a form within Mautic I will need to create a form folder and a FormFieldsType.php file which will define each of those fields. (The FormFields part of the name must match the class name but can be anything you want, and the Type part of the file name is necessary so Mautic will find and autoload this file).

**FormSubscriber.php:** Again, this file is named related to the class name it contains so that it will be automatically loaded by the system. I have called this one FormSubscriber to help me remember that this is a subscribed event for forms.

As with most parts of the system you will want to ensure that your naming is consistent throughout your plugin. Specifically the classname and namespace of your files as they relate to your config.php file. Don’t worry too much about this for right now as we’ll get into this in more detail in the next post.

### Prepare 3rd Party API

I’m going to list this as part of the initial setup because it’s important to have this ready early on in your plugin development process. You will need to find and prepare your 3rd party API. This might involve creating an account, retrieving an API ID and API Key or similar. Basically you want to make sure when you’re ready to make an API call (later in this series) you will have everything ready to go and already setup.

For this tutorial I discovered that Desk.com uses Basic Authentication for handling interaction with their API and I simply needed to know my email address and password associated with my Desk.com account.

### Mautic Developer Reference

In addition to the 3rd party API service and knowing what functionality is available from them you will also need to know the various endpoints, listeners, and more available within Mautic. You''ll want to keep a browser tab open with the [Mautic Developer Docs](https://developer.mautic.org) loaded up. You can browse that information here: [https://developer.mautic.org](https://developer.mautic.org)

### Next Step

The next step after defining our purpose and looking at the basic plugin structure will be to begin writing all the necessary files to their respective folders and begin the process. We will get into this in the next article in this tutorial series.', 'We continue to push the Mautic free marketing automation software to be bigger and better than anything else available. A new feature coming soon to a future release of Mautic is one that we know will be extremely exciting. The <strong>Mautic Marketplace</strong> will allow everyone to share their plugins, themes, workflows, campaign templates and more. In preparation for this upcoming feature we’ll be creating a series of articles related to the development of a Mautic plugin to help you as you look to create your first Mautic plugin.

I’ll be covering how to <strong>create a Mautic plugin from start to finish</strong> in a series of posts that I hope will bring clarity and understanding to the entire process and answer any questions that arise during the process. If you get stuck I encourage you to jump into the forum to ask your questions and help others too!

Before we begin let’s look quickly at what a plugin is and why we care about creating them. With this idea of plugins Mautic functions very similar to something like WordPress. Plugins allow you to do a number of things from integrating other software systems and software tools to modifying the functionality of Mautic. <strong>Plugins let you extend Mautic however you need.</strong> This is one of the greatest benefits of an open source marketing platform like Mautic. You have full access to view the source code, examine existing plugins and improve the core by suggesting additional triggers or listener events.
<blockquote>Want a concrete example? A Mautic plugin might let you push data from a lead to an external CRM system. The plugin will listen for a specific action and when that action occurs will trigger an event that pushes data to some other system. Here’s a second example: A Mautic plugin might modify all your landing page URL’s and other external URL’s to use a link-shortening system (like Bitly) before they are rendered and displayed to the end user.</blockquote>
Ok, so that’s an idea of what a plugin might do and a couple of examples of how they might be used. I think that’s enough background. Let’s start planning what our sample plugin will do that we’re going to create together.
<h2>Step 1: Plan Your Plugin</h2>
<h3>Purpose of the Plugin</h3>
I want to create a plugin that pushes some information from Mautic to an external service. I have decided for the purpose of this tutorial series that I want to create a plugin that will let me create a form within Mautic and push the results of that form to Desk.com, a ticketing system.

At a high-level review, I am looking to create a plugin that will let me use Mautic to push support tickets into my support system but use Mautic for form collection and submission. By doing this I will be able to do a few different things. First, this will let me demonstrate how to create a plugin that needs additional configuration fields defined. Second, this plugin will add a new form action to standalone forms that will allow me to push my form submissions to some other system via an API. Third, this plugin will give me the opportunity to write a couple different listeners. And lastly, I can show some advanced techniques for field mapping.
<h3>Outline Basic Plugin Structure</h3>
Now that we have identified the purpose of our plugin this will help me to outline the basic plugin structure I want to use. Here is my basic plugin structure:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-772" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mautic_desk_plugin_files.png" alt="Create mautic plugin file structure" width="620" height="352" />

INSERT INTO mtorg_db.rainlab_blog_posts (id, user_id, title, slug, excerpt, content, content_html, published_at, published, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (780, 0, 'How to Use the Mautic Rest API', 'how-to-use-the-mautic-rest-api', '', 'Mautic has a great API to interact with other systems. There is a powerful [PHP REST API library](https://github.com/mautic/api-library) for faster integration with PHP projects. This Mautic API requires [oAuth (1a or 2) authentication](http://blog.varonis.com/introduction-to-oauth/). In case you''re unaware, these REST API calls are great for integration with your current system(s). You can simply create a lead or move a lead to a smart list when the lead does something within your app. Here are the basic steps to getting started with the Mautic API.

### 1. Install the Mautic API with Composer

API library is at [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/mautic/api-library). So simple `composer require mautic/api-library` command will installation of the library to your project for you. Composer will also automatically include the library to your project.

### 2. Alternate Ways to Install Mautic API

If your project doesn''t use Composer yet, don''t worry! You can either [clone it from GitHub](https://github.com/mautic/api-library) or [download the ZIP](https://github.com/mautic/api-library/archive/master.zip) package and copy the library folder to your project. Let''s look quickly at those two methods and how you would go about using them.

#### Install by git clone



	2. Go to your project folder where you want to place Mautic API library to be. For example:
`cd /var/www/html/myproject`
	4. Run git clone to this folder
`git clone git@github.com:mautic/api-library.git .`
*(the dot at the end means current folder)*



#### Copy from ZIP package



	2. Download the library from [https://github.com/mautic/api-library/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/mautic/api-library/archive/master.zip)
	4. Extract the package to some temporary location.
	6. Copy the `/lib` folder to your project.



### 3. How to Authorize Your Mautic API Application

To use API calls, your application has to be authorized in Mautic instance you want to connect with. Mautic supports OAuth1 and OAuth2. I''ll focus to OAuth1 since it doesn''t require HTTPS. If your application has some kind of administration, you''ll need to add 3 text inputs and an Authorization button.

#### Get authorization keys in Mautic

You can create specific authorization API credentials for each connected application. To do that, go to your Mautic administration and follow these steps:


	2. Go to Mautic Configuration / API Settings and set ''API enabled'' to ''Yes'', leave ''API mode'' to ''OAuth1''. Save changes.
	4. At the right-hand side menu where Configuration is should appear the new menu item ''API Credentials''. Click this menu item.
	6. Create a new set of credentials. Fill in the ''Name'' (name of your app for example) and the Callback URL (URL where your app will be listening responses from Mautic). Save your new credentials.
	8. Mautic will generate ''Consumer Key'' and ''Consumer Secret'' key.



#### Create authorization form

If you don''t want to hard-code authorization details then you can create a form with the following text inputs: **Mautic Base URL**, **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret** with **Save & Authorize** button. This form should not be accessible for public.
**Note**: You can test authorization and API requests in build-in API Tester. You can find it in the /apitester directory of Mautic API Library.

#### Handle authorization request

When the user for your app hits **Save & Authorize**, this is how you will handle the request:

```
// @todo check if the request is sent from user with admin rights
// @todo check if Base URL, Consumer/Client Key and Consumer/Client secret are not empty

// @todo load this array from database or config file
$accessTokenData = array(
    ''accessToken'' => '''',
    ''accessTokenSecret'' => '''',
    ''accessTokenExpires'' => ''''
);

// @todo Sanitize this URL. Make sure it starts with http/https and doesn''t end with ''/''
$mauticBaseUrl = $_POST[''mauticBaseUrl''];

$settings = array(
    ''baseUrl''           => $mauticBaseUrl,
    ''clientKey''         => $_POST[''clientKey''],
    ''clientSecret''      => $_POST[''clientSecret''],
    ''callback''          => ''http://yourapp.com'', // @todo Change this to your app callback. It should be the same as you entered when you were creating your Mautic API credentials.
    ''version''           => ''OAuth1a''
);

if (!empty($accessTokenData[''accessToken'']) && !empty($accessTokenData[''accessTokenSecret''])) {
    $settings[''accessToken'']        = $accessTokenData[''accessToken''] ;
    $settings[''accessTokenSecret'']  = $accessTokenData[''accessTokenSecret''];
    $settings[''accessTokenExpires''] = $accessTokenData[''accessTokenExpires''];
}

$auth = \\Mautic\\Auth\\ApiAuth::initiate($settings);

if ($auth->validateAccessToken()) {
    if ($auth->accessTokenUpdated()) {
        $accessTokenData = $auth->getAccessTokenData();
        // @todo Save $accessTokenData
        // @todo Display success authorization message
    } else {
        // @todo Display info message that this app is already authorized.
    }
} else {
    // @todo Display info message that the token is not valid.
}
```

The workflow can be broken down like this:


	2. Admin user fills in the Access Keys and Mautic Base URL to the form.
	4. If `$accessTokenData` aren''t known yet, `$auth->validateAccessToken()` will redirect user to Mautic where he can authorize the app.
	6. After user confirms authorization, Mautic will redirect him back (to the Callback URL) to your app.
	8. `$auth->getAccessTokenData()` will return $accessTokenData which you have to save.


Live examples of authorization can be found at:


	- [Mautic API Tester](https://github.com/mautic/api-library/blob/master/apitester/index.php)
	- [Mautic-Joomla plugin](https://github.com/escopecz/mautic-joomla/blob/master/mautic.php#L170)



### 4. Making API Calls

Finally the fun part. I suppose the most frequently used REST API call will be to create new lead in Mautic. For example, if a visitor submits a form in your app. Since this is probably the most widely used, here is an example of the code to do this:
**Note:**`$auth` and `$mauticBaseUrl` are the same as from the code above. It would be clever to add those to methods to have them accessible from different places

```
$leadApi    = \\Mautic\\MauticApi::getContext(
    "leads",
    $auth,
    $mauticBaseUrl . ''/api/''
);

$lead = $leadApi->create(array(
    ''ipAddress'' => $_SERVER[''REMOTE_ADDR''],
    ''firstname'' => $formData[''firstname''],
    ''lastname''  => $formData[''lastname''],
    ''email''     => $formData[''email''],
));
```

There is so much more you can do. Fortunately all of these API examples and more are described here in the [API Library Documentation](https://github.com/mautic/api-library#using-the-mautic-api-library). Don''t wait, get started now building something amazing!

Do you have a green thumb when it comes to marketing? Do you just barely touch something and it springs to life?

The idea of lead nurturing is a common topic in marketing chats and a frequent point of discussion whenever marketers and sales people get together. I used the term “green thumb” because that’s a very common gardening term that usually refers to someone who is naturally gifted (or at least appears to be) when it comes to nurturing plants or flowers in their gardens. They seem to be able to make something grow out of nothing and they can keep plants alive for a long time. That last point is especially tricky for me. For some reason keeping plants alive and growing is insanely difficult for me. Just ask anyone in the office and they’ll tell you - *the ideal plant for me is a cactus.*

I think just as with gardening there are some people who are just naturally gifted at nurturing and growing leads in business as well. And just as with having a green thumb in gardening I believe everyone can learn this ability and talent. What is lead nurturing you ask? Well, quite simply put lead nurturing is the process of growing and keeping alive a potential customer for your business until they become a customer. This process involves paying attention to their needs, watering them, and providing optimal conditions for their growth. It really is quite similar to gardening. Nurturing in its simplest form is simply the act of encouraging growth and life.

## 3 Steps to Amazing Lead Nurturing

If we can identify what lead nurturing is and how the lead generation process funnels directly into a lead nurturing process then we can begin to identify how to do lead nurturing right. The process shouldn’t be tricky or confusing. Don’t let the unknown words trick you into not doing amazing lead nurturing. Let’s get started.

### ![Every lead is a seed to nurture](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/lead_nurturing_start_early-1024x659.jpg)



### 1. Lead Nurturing Starts Early

When you’re growing a plant or a flower many times you will start with a seed. There’s not flower, there’s no root system, there’s really nothing more than a tiny seed. It doesn’t look anything like the beautiful flower you believe it will be in the future.

Now I want you to imagine with me that you’re in a garden with your friend. The two of you have gotten up on a cool spring morning and met in the flower bed behind your house to plant some beautiful tulips you’ve just gotten in. Now as you kneel in the dirt next to your friend you begin the process of digging the holes to place the flowers into. But your friend is not helping! In fact, he’s sitting there with a tulip bulb in his hand. As you watch him he turns it over slowly in his hand and then carelessly tosses it over his shoulder before selecting another from the bag. He does this again and again, until finally you stop him and ask what he’s doing throwing these great tulip bulbs away! What would you say if his response was that these weren’t tulips at all because they didn’t look anything like a tulip. They weren’t even green!

Obviously you’d be shocked and a bit confused that your friend didn’t understand the potential these tulip bulbs held to become stunningly beautiful tulips…when they bloomed. You would have to explain to him that these seeds would turn into beautiful flowers, over time and with the proper care. They might not look like something beautiful now, but with the right care and love they would eventually grow to become a beautiful tulip. Lead nurturing should be done the same way. Lead nurturing must start early, well before your lead actually even looks like a lead. You have to nurture them with attention, love, and care. You have to understand the potential each lead has to become a beautiful customer.

### 2. Lead Nurturing Is Consistent

Continuing with our story in the garden, the tulips you planted are continually in need of care. You will need to water them regularly, ensure they get proper sunlight, and maintain ideal temperatures. In short, you have to care for their survival with constant and consistent attention. The same happens when you are nurturing leads in your marketing. You have to consistently water (sending timely information), you have to make sure they get proper sunlight (providing relevant information), and maintain ideal temperatures (offer easy ways to respond). Did you get those? Let me highlight them again and provide a sentence or two more detail on each.

**Send Timely Information:** Don’t flood new leads with information immediately upon the first time you make contact with them. Just like when watering a plant, you want to send information consistently over time. Nurture leads daily, weekly, or monthly as appropriate for your particular market or industry.

**Provide Relevant Information:** Don’t spam your leads with information that’s not relevant. You want to shed light on questions they have and provide answers to problems. You want to be sunshine and warmth for them in the sense of being an environment that encourages their growth and development. Continually.

**Make Responses Easy:** You want to be listening to your leads as you nurture them. You need to consistently provide ways for leads to become customers. This is the ideal temperature aspect of nurturing. If you provide a consistent way for leads to respond you give them an optimal “warm and fuzzy” feeling for growth and development.

### 3. Lead Nurturing Takes Time

The last thing to remember when nurturing leads is the important aspect that everything takes time. If you’ve ever planted anything before you know the results are not instant. You have to follow the process. You have to trust that the things you do day in and day out without seeing any immediate results are serving a purpose and doing something greater. You’ll see the results if you are consistent in following your processes. Your ongoing watering, providing relevant information, and making feedback easy should begin very early and must be consistent. You’ll see results over time. Now, some leads may be much faster to grow and bloom but most will take time.

> Lead nurturing requires patient and persistent marketing.

I know one of my own biggest weaknesses is patience. I work all the time on being more patient and letting things unfold but it’s still a struggle I must face every day. Nurturing leads takes time. But let me be clear on this point about one thing. Just because this takes time does not mean passively waiting; instead we must do active waiting.

### Lead Nurturing Software

Lead nurturing software like Mautic helps you accomplish these steps. No longer stress about being consistent or contacting each lead at the optimal time. With a strong lead nurturing platform you can automate the lead process and still personalize each point of contact with your potential customer. A lead management software system helps nurture leads by making you consistent in your approach. This is one of the greatest benefits to using a marketing automation and lead nurturing platform like Mautic. I know for myself, this struggling to be patient and consistent is one of my biggest problems and Mautic makes it easy to be both consistent in my lead contact and patient in my approach.

We must stay actively engaged in nurturing and growing a lead using the steps mentioned above. So don’t lose heart, don’t give up easy. Be consistent and be patient. And understand that nurturing your leads takes time. Water those leads and watch them bloom into an awesome customer!', '<h3>Green thumb?</h3>
Do you have a green thumb when it comes to marketing? Do you just barely touch something and it springs to life?

The idea of lead nurturing is a common topic in marketing chats and a frequent point of discussion whenever marketers and sales people get together. I used the term “green thumb” because that’s a very common gardening term that usually refers to someone who is naturally gifted (or at least appears to be) when it comes to nurturing plants or flowers in their gardens. They seem to be able to make something grow out of nothing and they can keep plants alive for a long time. That last point is especially tricky for me. For some reason keeping plants alive and growing is insanely difficult for me. Just ask anyone in the office and they’ll tell you - <em>the ideal plant for me is a cactus.</em>

I think just as with gardening there are some people who are just naturally gifted at nurturing and growing leads in business as well. And just as with having a green thumb in gardening I believe everyone can learn this ability and talent. What is lead nurturing you ask? Well, quite simply put lead nurturing is the process of growing and keeping alive a potential customer for your business until they become a customer. This process involves paying attention to their needs, watering them, and providing optimal conditions for their growth. It really is quite similar to gardening. Nurturing in its simplest form is simply the act of encouraging growth and life.
<h2>3 Steps to Amazing Lead Nurturing</h2>
If we can identify what lead nurturing is and how the lead generation process funnels directly into a lead nurturing process then we can begin to identify how to do lead nurturing right. The process shouldn’t be tricky or confusing. Don’t let the unknown words trick you into not doing amazing lead nurturing. Let’s get started.

In this case you would want to perform some set of actions a single time immediately upon form submission.

Because of these descriptions you will notice that the standalone form has an **actions** tab in addition to the standard details and fields tab.

It’s an all-too familiar business environment and it can be frustrating to just about everyone (except the stuffed shirt overusing the acronym). In fact, it can be so annoying you might be tempted to intentionally avoid those buzzwords. But your ROI, or **Return on Investment**, should not be avoided. Nobody says you have to overuse the three letter catch phrase to correctly identify and establish a plan for maximizing your profitability. Let’s talk for a bit about how you can analyze and plan for the best return on your investment without turning into a talking head throwing out annoying three-letter land mines.

## What are the key factors in marketing that determine your potential return on investment?

We are going to look at the various key factors that determine your marketing ROI and then identify where you are overspending and where you are underspending. Before you jump ahead to recommendations though you need to follow through each of the following steps as it will be important to give you a full picture of your own marketing department.

### Start by identifying your measurable expenses

The first thing to consider when looking to calculate your marketing ROI are the expenses involved in your marketing. You can’t properly identify your potential profits without knowing what your expenses will be. Let’s look at a short list of potential expenses you will have.


	- Software licensing
	- Integrations, customizations, and unique adaptations to your business
	- On-boarding and training
	- Data collecting and cleaning
	- Content creation
	- Email creation and delivery
	- Digital asset creation
	- Print asset creation
	- Physical marketing / distribution


There are many expenses once you start looking at how you spend money in your marketing. This list is definitely not comprehensive nor should it be. Every business will have a unique set of expenses. This list serves only as a general guide to cover some categories similar to many industries. *(Great news: [some of these expenses can be completely eliminated](https://www.mautic.org)!)*
**Homework**
Your homework is to create your own list of expenses. Identify everything you are spending for your marketing. Don’t exaggerate but don’t leave anything out either. If you spend 3 hours a month writing a blog post then be sure you calculate an hourly rate and add that cost as a line item in your expense list. You want to create a comprehensive total of all the expenses your marketing costs.

### Estimate your intangible expenses

This is the second part of the identifying your expenses and admittedly this part is much harder. We need to identify and estimate the intangible expenses for your marketing. This means looking at metrics that you can’t measure and estimating the cost of each. Don’t let that phrasing confuse you, here’s a simple explanation. If you send an email newsletter you can calculate the cost associated with the time to create it, and the service you use to deliver it; but it’s much harder to estimate what it costs for each email to be read vs dropped immediately into a spam folder. Or another example, you can’t put an exact cost on maintaining brand consistency across your marketing.

Here’s a short list of potential intangible expenses


	- Maintaining brand consistency
	- Improving customer satisfaction
	- Maximizing email readability
	- Staying relevant in an industry


As you can see these are much more difficult to put an exact cost on. And you may identify other intangible or “soft expenses” for your marketing that haven’t been listed here. You should use this list as a guide to help you as you complete your marketing roi homework task.
**Homework**
Add to the expense list you created in the first homework section. Add values for each intangible expense. Again, this will be an approximation and you probably won’t be exactly right with these numbers but you need to create at least a baseline to give you a good understanding of you entire marketing expenses.

### Next step, create your revenue projections

Once you have a good idea what your expenses will be you need to turn your focus to your potential revenue opportunities. What are the goals you want to accomplish with your marketing? What are the desired outcomes you want to see, Just as with the previous section this will contain both tangible and intangible aspects.

### List your measurable revenues

The first revenues we will write down in our growing list are those revenues which we can easily identify. Here are a few examples of measurable revenues:


	- New monthly subscription
	- Single purchase customer
	- Purchase of services
	- Support and training sales


These revenues should not be difficult for you to determine, this is the reason your business exists and what your goals are as a company. Keep in mind all potential ways your business generates revenue.
**Homework**
Add a revenues section to your list (maybe you were so bold as to even create a spreadsheet?). Write down your measurable revenues. One thing you will need to consider is how you have quantified your revenues. You should create these items in the same metric as your expenses. *(Does that sound tricky? Think of it like this: if your expenses are organized by month then you should organize your revenues by month as well.)*

### List your intangible revenues

This is often the part that is forgotten when creating an ROI analysis. You cannot focus merely on the measurable and tangible revenues. You must in addition to these also identify and recognize the intangible benefits of your marketing efforts. Since this is much harder to quantify and list as a definite amount you will need to be as precise as possible but recognize this as the most subjective of the entire marketing roi process.

Here are some examples of intangible benefits you will receive from your marketing efforts.


	- Expanded brand awareness
	- Improved processes and efficient marketing
	- Saved marketing hours
	- Reduced human error
	- Accelerated community growth


These are representative of a number of potential benefits you will receive from your marketing expenses. Your actual identified intangibles may be different.
**Homework**
List your intangible revenues on your worksheet. Do your best to quantify these with numbers but recognize those numbers may be subject to questions by others. Other “soft revenues” such as saved time can be more easily estimated. There are many ways to get an estimate on these values. Here is [a resource](http://www.balabanis.com/marketresearch/brand.pdf) that might be helpful.

### Finally put it all together

Once you have compiled a list of all these different sections you can now begin to put it all together and determine your overall marketing return on investment. You can now perform some math (basic math) to identify what you are spending and what you are making as a direct result of your marketing. This is your ROI. You have created a list of what you spend and a list of what you make.

Of course you will need to keep in mind that there will be other factors influencing your company’s revenue beyond just the marketing expenses (e.g. the quality of the product, the demand for the product etc.) But this will give you a fairly good idea of how your marketing impacts your revenues.

One of the biggest marketing expenses is related to the various software tools you use. You’ll notice in the above lists that several items directly relate to your marketing software.

A recent study shared in the Harvard Business Review brings the marketplace of the mind closer to key business factors: How typical a brand is of the category it’s in – how central it is – and also how distinctive it is. That leads to a matrix with four quadrants in which your offering might fall.  




- **Aspirational:** This quadrant houses brands that are highly distinctive but also hold wide appeal.
- **Mainstream:** Customers have little trouble identifying brands that are typical of an industry and this quadrant represents those quite typical but lacking much distinctiveness from competitors.
- **Unconventional:** These brands score high on distinctiveness but are viewed as atypical of the category.
- **Peripheral:** These brands lack centrality or distinctiveness.

Some claim incredible benefits from cold calling while others emphatically insist this practice is pointless.

This post is not on the merits of cold-calling. In fact I want to draw your attention to another important step in the sales process that too often gets overlooked and neglected. I want to discuss how you can improve your sales process by defining goals and using these goals as a metric by which you define and measure your success as a salesperson. Now that sounds fairly typical, but let me break it down a bit more.

One phrase that’s commonly used among sales people (if this describes you don’t worry I won’t ask for a show of hands), is the popular phrase, “Just checking in.” or “touching base” or even “following up”. These phrases are the exact opposite of a goal-driven sales approach. I’ll explain what I mean.

> “Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.”
- Benjamin Franklin

Whenever you find yourself using one of these fallback phrases here is what you are really doing. You are attempting to keep a connection open with a potential customer. You are making an attempt to look active and appear engaged. But it’s a weak attempt. These type of touch points don’t encourage any action or behavior from your lead. These phrases don’t illicit any response. They are not goal driven expressions. Instead, here are 3 ways to improve your sales process and marketing efforts by using a goal-driven approach.

### Goal Driven Phone Calls

When you’re on the phone with a potential lead you want to use phrases, questions, and conversation that nurtures the lead closer to making a decision. Your questions should be goal driven not merely touching base. When you ask someone how they are doing you ask them for a general status update. When you ask someone how you can help them, or when would be a good time to meet to discuss a potential deal you are asking leading questions which lead the contact to complete a goal. Be purposeful in the reason for your call and ask clear, easy-to-answer questions.

### Goal Driven Emails

The second and most common methods for communication with clients is through email. This is such a huge danger zone the text in this paragraph should probably be in red. Salespeople around the world fall victim to the “touching base” email threads. They don’t say anything relevant, they don’t ask for any specific action by the lead. Instead your goal driven emails should include clear and simple actionable items. For example, consider asking about feedback from a recent phone call; or maybe you’ll want to ask your customer for a response to a single question; or schedule a meeting. Whatever you choose, be sure your email needs an answer and preferably more than a one-word response.

### Goal Driven Meetings

The last of the three ways you can focus on being goal driven involves your meetings. Don’t take meetings that don’t serve a purpose. It’s been said before but it can be too easy to jump into sales meetings or believe you need to “stop in” and visit with a lead simply because it’s been a while since you last met with them. Instead you can show them you value their time by not wasting time. Visit your leads with a plan and a purpose. And “catching up” is not a purpose. You should define a distinct goal or outcome you want to achieve by meeting with them. A couple example goals might be either signing a contract or demonstrating a new service or feature relevant to the customer’s needs.

By focusing your lead contact strategies on goal driven methods you will find you spend your time more effectively and your customers will understand the value you place on their time as well. Be goal driven and have a purpose when you connect with your potential customers you’ll be glad you did.', 'There are few things as dreaded as making cold-calls as a salesperson.

Developer’s love APIs. There are APIs for everything. The popular ones like Google’s javascript mapping APIs, or Twitter’s REST apis. Amazingly useful APIs like Stripe and Paypal for running a business. APIs rule the world.

However, APIs aren’t everything, and they definitely can leave holes in your application’s integration when it comes data. This is because your application because responsible to go and *fetch* information from an API; or go and put information into that remote application using an API call.

What happens when that data can be changed by either application? Imagine a situation where you’re taking lead information from your website, and storing it in Mautic. But you also have another application that you want to house the information. You could use [Mautic’s REST API](https://www.mautic.org/blog/how-to-use-the-mautic-rest-api/) and continually go and fetch new information, merge with any data you’ve curated on your own, and maintain a synced set of data that way.

You don’t have to think about that solution very long before you start realizing where it falls short - synchronized changes become a nightmare. What happens if a remote application changes some data?

A Mautic example might be a lead has the bounced flag added to it. Now your application has to be responsible to re-fetch that information. And your application can’t know that change has occurred, so it has to continually poll that external resource to keep that data synced. It can be a hassle for any application to continually do this. Add in other complications like API limits, which many large API providers like Paypal, Twitter, Google, and Facebook all enforce, and you’re left with a very likely possibility that at some point, you will not have an accurate representation of your data. This would be a lot like taking a roller coaster ride without knowing if the tracks in the loop are complete - you could end up careening to a swift and painful stop! Scary.

### Enter Webhooks

Webhooks are a fantastic solution, guaranteed to save you time and money. A webhook is an HTTP URL endpoint supported by your third party application, which can receive a POST. It feels a lot like a REST API, but for you application’s purposes it is just one half of the API (eg: all the POST endpoints). That endpoint URL is then “executed” each time an “event” occurs. Webhooks close the roller coaster loop and ensure a safe ride for all your data passengers.

Adding webhooks to an application where data is changing constantly is a perfect solution to the API loophole, because now we know that data has changed, and our application just has to be responsible to receive the payload and update it appropriately.

Gone is the need to continually poll the remote resource to find out if data has changed, update it, and then check again in a little while to do the exact same check. This eliminates so many variables. API limits become a non-issue, out of sync data liabilities are reduced, and CPU cycles get saved by everyone in the transaction.

### Webhooks are Simple

Webhooks are perfect at sharing bits of data on-time, when an event occurs, to a remote resource. This is usually all third party developers want from remote systems anyway. In these situations, using an API instead of a Webhook would be massive overkill. Using a webhook avoids the cost and time associated with building out an entire application to support API endpoints.

Next time you’re planning to create a full blown API for your application, ask yourself if the problem you’re trying to solve could be solved with some event listeners and a webhook call to a remote resource.', '<h2>Use Webhooks to Close the Integration Loop</h2>

### Straight Outta Compton

"It seems as if there has been a new must-read piece about [N.W.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A), [Straight Outta Compton](http://www.straightouttacompton.com/) or gangsta rap every single day for the last few months. The release of F Gary Gray’s flick on group has served as the hook for so many people to relive the halycon days of old and there have been many fine pieces of work as a result.

But Straight Outta Compton is one of times when the marketing folks managed to work every single angle for the best possible result. Be it the way in which [that iconic poster was pimped out](http://www.straightouttasomewhere.com/) or even the way in which a lot of the narrative around the Dre album was all about the film, Straight Outta Compton’s sales pitch could not have been better scripted. It helps, of course, that there was a lot of articles waiting to be written about that era and the film presented the perfect excuse."

### Beyond Email: **Use Multi-channel marketing automation to generate and nurture leads**

"While marketing automation is a hot topic across industries, many marketers are daunted by the complexities of combining customer journeys, content strategies, and dense technologies. Marketing automation technology allows marketers to generate and nurture leads with sequenced, segmented, and automated campaigns that deliver content at scale, with minimal intervention. Automation can be used to dynamically change content; test messaging; and sequence messages and notifications. As with any marketing initiative, the goal should always be focused on providing content that benefits your customers."
**Top ways mentioned in this article include: email, websites, social media, and mobile.**

### Why you can’t get buy-in for your great marketing ideas

"It’s not entirely their fault, though. Unfortunately, many marketers are restricted by their boss’s reluctance to invest in new ideas and approaches to marketing. Why spend thousands of dollars to fix what isn’t broken? It doesn’t matter that a new approach could reach an entirely new audience, or help you reach your existing customers more effectively. Stepping out of the marketing comfort zone when the bottom line is at stake is scary."

The release of F Gary Gray’s flick on group has served as the hook for so many people to relive the halycon days of old and there have been many fine pieces of work as a result.

But Straight Outta Compton is one of times when the marketing folks managed to work every single angle for the best possible result. Be it the way in which <a href="http://www.straightouttasomewhere.com/">that iconic poster was pimped out</a> or even the way in which a lot of the narrative around the Dre album was all about the film, Straight Outta Compton’s sales pitch could not have been better scripted. It helps, of course, that there was a lot of articles waiting to be written about that era and the film presented the perfect excuse."

<h3>Beyond Email: <b>Use Multi-channel marketing automation to generate and nurture leads</b></h3>
"While marketing automation is a hot topic across industries, many marketers are daunted by the complexities of combining customer journeys, content strategies, and dense technologies. Marketing automation technology allows marketers to generate and nurture leads with sequenced, segmented, and automated campaigns that deliver content at scale, with minimal intervention. Automation can be used to dynamically change content; test messaging; and sequence messages and notifications. As with any marketing initiative, the goal should always be focused on providing content that benefits your customers."
<p><div class="info info-alert"><strong>Top ways mentioned in this article include: email, websites, social media, and mobile.</strong></div></p>

<h3>Why you can’t get buy-in for your great marketing ideas</h3>
"It’s not entirely their fault, though. Unfortunately, many marketers are restricted by their boss’s reluctance to invest in new ideas and approaches to marketing. Why spend thousands of dollars to fix what isn’t broken? It doesn’t matter that a new approach could reach an entirely new audience, or help you reach your existing customers more effectively. Stepping out of the marketing comfort zone when the bottom line is at stake is scary."
<ul>
	<li>You focus on tactics not results</li>
	<li>You don’t highlight the competition</li>
	<li>You don’t pay attention to cost</li>

In marketing, this is never more true than when dealing with marketing automation systems. The volume of programs, emails, landing pages, and other digital assets can be staggering - and conflicts happen. Learning to use a marketing automation program is partially trial-and-error, but you can also learn from the mistakes of other marketers like yourself. The following are three of the most common marketing automation mistakes, and suggestions for preventing these mistakes in your own organization.

### 1. Outdated Content/Assets


#### The Problem

In just a year, think of the number of individual marketing assets that you produce. Between landing pages, sales alerts, operational emails, newsletters, webinar registration pages, and a host of other content types, a company might build and operate thousands of individual assets. With marketing automation, it is trivially easy to create, clone, and approve new assets - but keeping track of existing content is a problem of its own.

If all of your assets are created individually, editing HTML landing pages and emails is difficult and time-consuming. A simple change like editing the Copyright date to keep the page current could take hours of searching through approved landing pages, to say nothing of a more involved change like a brand refresh, color palette change, or address change.

#### The Solution

When you create content, you should always consider the lifecycle of the content - and any potential changes that might have to be made throughout that timeframe. Making your content easier to edit will save you a great deal of time in the long run, and there are tools in most marketing automation systems that are designed to help. For example, Marketo allows users to use "tokens" as common elements across assets in the same workspace - so you could create a "Copyright Date" token, using the token instead of manually entering in the date when you create an asset. This way, you only have to edit the value of the token in a single location, rather than having to edit the copyright date in every single asset where it has been used.

Similarly, using common assets and templates will save you an enormous amount of time in the long run. For example, if all of your webinars use more/less the same structure for their landing pages, you really only need a single webinar landing page - dynamically populating things like the webinar title, images, and form ID with the URL parameters that you use to direct people to that page. Thank you pages, sales alerts, and fulfillment emails can be set up the same way - dramatically reducing the total count of individual assets that you have to manage. Instead of using inline CSS, consider pointing your landing pages to a single stylesheet on your primary company website - giving you the ability to manage your brand style (fonts, colors, etc.) from one location instead of forcing you to jump back into the visual editors every time you need to make a change.

### 2. Failure to Keep Sales Team in Mind


#### The Problem

The ''Best Practices'' for marketing and sales aren''t always aligned, but B2B companies live and die by their sales teams. Still, far too many marketing departments fail to keep their sales teams in mind - either in the beginning of the marketing automation process when they are designing channels, scoring, and data hygiene elements, or down the road when they are building out landing pages and forms.

For example, have you ever reduced the number of fields on one of your registration forms - hoping to increase the conversion rate by simplifying the amount of data required by your leads? From a marketing perspective, this makes sense - since it simplifies the user experience and increases lead volume, but your sales team might not see things the same way. After all, what is a sales rep supposed to do with a "hot lead" that doesn''t have a phone number to call? Without region/state information, how is your CRM system supposed to identify which field sales division the lead should be passed to?

#### The Solution

Keep the sales team in mind throughout the marketing automation process - from planning meetings during implementation through weekly stand up meetings as you continue to send leads to their department. To ensure that your CRM system and marketing automation system are communicating effectively, at least one of your marketing automation specialists should be trained on your CRM, and should understand the way that the fields/objects are being used by the sales personnel.

While you might keep some forms (newsletter, for example) as single-field entries, and you might choose to leave some of your content ungated for the sake of web traffic, the majority of your forms should be utilized for lead generation - and should contain the necessary fields for your sales team to follow up. Sales alerts can be used to enforce SLAs and ensure that hot leads aren''t dropped by the sales team, and your scoring system can be continuously refined to find a balance between lead quality and lead volume. Over time, you will also need to develop programs within your marketing automation system that will watch for duplicate records, append lead source information, and provide some commentary for salespeople so they can understand the buyer''s journey through your content without having to access the marketing automation platform. A customer note that states "Customer attended 4/15 Data Security Webinar" is a lot more useful to a novice salesperson than an acquisition program field that uses your (relatively) opaque naming conventions.

### 3. Too Many Cooks in the Kitchen


#### The Problem

The last problem is one that might not show up for a while... but one that can completely derail your success with a marketing automation platform. As you continue to use your marketing automation system, different programs and assets will accumulate in a complex web of interdependencies. A single webinar might call from dozens of different templates, operational programs, scoring routines, and lead lists - and changes to any of these building blocks could result in program errors, or in content that doesn''t look or function like it was intended. The more people that are working in your marketing automation instance, the more likely these errors become.

Multi-field dependency routines are the most common source of errors. In this type of error, two separate fields both change their values based on the value of the other field - like a lead status and a customer lifecycle status field that both read each other and try to stay in sync. This is usually a result of

new fields being created to replace legacy fields; when the marketing team just adds to their existing fields rather than deleting the old one. The problem with this type of field relationship is that it can cause a constant loop - where leads advance in one field before the other, and then that same field goes back to its original status because it is trying to stay in sync with the legacy field. For example, a "yes/no" marketing qualified legacy field might not be updated anymore, but if your new lead status field changes itself as a response to checkbox changes, it might not allow leads to become qualified since it is reading the "no" value in the older field. With lots of people adding their own "spin" on your marketing and operational programs, unintended errors like this are common.

#### The Solution

Separate your marketing programs and your operational programs, and give permissions for the latter only to a single person!

There is no reason for a webinar campaign/program to edit fields like lead score, qualification, lead status, etc. Instead, the webinar program can be used to "call" a totally separate campaign/program that lives within the operational folder and performs all of the follow-up data changes associated with your webinar channel. This way, you don''t have to worry about your various programs changing data values, attributions, or qualification steps - and you can maintain a single list of programs where your scoring and your lead pipeline can be fine-tuned.

With this type of organization, not only can you stop worrying that a content writer might accidentally break your lead lifecycle programs with an accidental field change, but you can also speed the development of your scoring system - since all of your scoring values and changes will be in a single folder (or will be on a single page of tokens, in the case of Marketo). By maintaining the operational permissions under a single account - you can also "trust" inexperienced users to create content, duplicate marketing programs, etc., without giving them the ability to approve programs and make sweeping architecture changes on their own.

### Conclusion

Marketing automation is a critical business system, and it takes some planning to ensure that the architecture you create with a marketing automation platform will be compatible with the rest of your business. Traditionally, this amount of planning and technical uncertainty scared people away from marketing automation - since they''d be locked into a year long (expensive) contract without being able to use the system effectively. A system like [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org) relieves some of that stress, giving marketers the freedom to experiment on an open-source platform without the long-term contracts, and with a supportive community that will help marketers advance their skills and build a good foundation for their entire organization.

INSERT INTO mtorg_db.rainlab_blog_posts (id, user_id, title, slug, excerpt, content, content_html, published_at, published, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (870, 0, 'Are You Repurposing Content?', 'are-you-repurposing-content', '', 'Or maybe this introductory question should be: Are you wasting valuable assets? When you write original content are you maximizing it to the fullest potential? Your original content should be used for much more than a single blog article. Let’s look at what that means for your marketing plan and ways you should be repurposing content.

### Blog Content

One of the first ways you can use your content is for the most obvious purpose of adding value to your website through your blog. This is more than likely the primary reason you started creating content in the first place so this is indeed the most obvious and first use for your content. Your blog helps you build credibility in your industry and improve your search engine optimization. This is clearly a primary purpose of your content marketing.

### Slideshare

Once you’ve created this amazing content you need to find as many possible outlets as you can to share it. Slideshares are a very trendy way to get your content out. Take your main points, and turn them into slides. But it’s not as easy as just dumping some content into slides. You will need to combine your text with graphics. Slides are a great way to communicate but they rely on creating a beautiful presentation to share your content. This repurposing content may take a little bit of additional time but compared to the original creation this time is minor an yet yields great return on your investment. ([This article goes into more depth on the benefits of slideshare](http://www.mnprblog.com/2013/07/6-business-benefits-of-slideshare-for.html)).

### Social Media

You will want to make sure you are repurposing your content for social media. This involves more than just sending a link out to your blog article! You need to craft compelling tweets, (be sure to leave at least 2 characters so others can retweet or +1 you) write good Facebook updates, and be sure to share on LinkedIn and Pinterest. This last one brings up a good point. Did you know social media posts with images are viewed and shared more than 40% times more than others? Find or create unique, engaging graphics to share relevant to your blog content.

### Podcast

Ever thought about the possibility of turning your blog articles into podcasts or audible posts? You may not find as great of search engine optimization from your content being audible instead of written, but you’ll find other benefits from podcasting including audience reach and a strong brand presence. Plus, think about the value that audio posts can hold for your audience. Attention spans are short, reading time is limited for many, but the opportunity to listen to your great content while doing other tasks is just one more convenience you can offer. Repurposing your content for audio requires a bit of minor reworking and you will need to ensure your audio setup is good quality (otherwise no one will want to listen) but again, a minor amount of work can lead to another outlet for your newly created content.

### Webinar & Video Shorts

In addition to the above content outlets don’t neglect the growing popularity of video. Creating video shorts from your content can be as simple as starting a [Periscope](http://periscope.com) and opening up discussion about your content. Or you could jump onto emerging video platforms like [Blab.im](http://blab.im) and start a modern webinar. This requires a bit of free thinking about how you can repurpose your content for this outlet but again, minimal work and you can capitalize on all the hard work you’ve invested in the original piece of content.

### Final Thought

There are a few things to consider before planning how you will repurpose you content. You don’t want to waste your time repurposing less than high-quality content. Be sure your original content is useful, holds value for your audience and is of appropriate length for repurposing. Once you make sure these guidelines are met then you have a great opportunity to repurpose your content and improve your outreach.', 'Or maybe this introductory question should be: Are you wasting valuable assets?

The ability to successfully deliver messages, the message creation, timing email delivery, all of these are aspects of email marketing that make this topic a challenging one. In fact, for these reasons and probably a few more the concept of open source email marketing has been practically non-existent. This is one reason why Mautic, and [open source marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/) has been so incredibly successful. For those not yet ready to dive into all that marketing automation can do for them, Mautic provides an incredible open source email marketing platform. Previously we’ve looked at how you can [begin using Mautic for level one email marketing](https://www.mautic.org/blog/email-marketing-level-one/) and just getting started. In this article we’ll look at a few specific ways you can use Mautic for your email marketing.

### The "Bi-Whenever" Newsletter

Some companies send newsletters every week, some send them bi-weekly, or some even send bi-monthly. Mautic gives you the power to send your bi-whenever newsletters quickly and efficiently. Using Mautic for your email marketing means being able to track clicks, opens, bounces and more. All the features you would expect to find in an email marketing system can be found in Mautic. But unlike the others, Mautic lets you run everything on your own server, or [integrate](https://www.mautic.org/integrations/) with direct email sending providers (SendGrid, Mandrill, Amazon, etc…) more on this later.

### The Special "Offer-vent"

You may also want to send emails to an audience when you have a special offer or event you want to tell them about. Maybe you want to let them know about something coming up and give them a special invitation. You want to be able to send each person a custom email and make it a personalized invitation. Mautic helps you with this in two ways. First, Mautic has an incredible page builder and email builder which you can use to quickly and easily create beautiful emails. You can create these emails with an easy-to-use drag and drop interface. Secondly, with Mautic as your open source email marketing system you can easily personalize every email and yet send only once. Using email templates you can bulk send emails to you lists of contacts and personalize each one (automatically).

### The Welcome Tickle

Lastly, you may want to configure your open source email marketing system to send an [automatic (and personal) email](https://www.mautic.org/blog/the-power-of-personal-emails/) to those users who have just signed up or subscribed to your services. Maybe they bought something or downloaded something or just asked for more information. With Mautic you can have triggers to automatically send an email when a form is submitted. This is great for a couple of reasons. First, this email can be sent immediately when the form is submitted (everyone likes instant gratification), or secondly, you can have Mautic schedule the email to send later at a pre-determined time. Maybe you want to make them wait a day before your email them. Whatever the reason and whatever the time, [Mautic lets you create and send the welcome email when you want](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/).

### The Spam Dilemma

Now, we should address one of the biggest concerns with an open source email marketing system. If you are familiar with marketing automation and sending bulk emails then you know one of the biggest hazards is getting blocked by SPAM filters. If you’re not careful you will have your server quickly blacklisted and your carefully crafted emails will never find the beautiful inbox of your intended recipient. We’ve been able to help solve this problem with a few creative solutions. First, you can define and create an opt-in process (required in some countries), quickly and easily within Mautic.

Second, with Mautic you can send the emails through your own server but if you rather you can just as easily have the actual email sending occur through a third party. This means if you want to have Mandrill (or others) send your emails it is as easy as adding in two pieces of information and you’re done. Mautic handles the rest for you.

### You Can Do Amazing Email Marketing

Open source marketing automation may be a relatively new and unfamiliar concept, but just about everyone understands email marketing. Mautic is the best open source email marketing software because it gives you everything you need to run powerful email marketing campaigns but also prepares you for using marketing automation as you become more familiar and comfortable with the idea. Your email lists, your contacts, your campaigns will already live within the best marketing automation system!', 'There are several challenges when it comes to email marketing. The ability to successfully deliver messages, the message creation, timing email delivery, all of these are aspects of email marketing that make this topic a challenging one. In fact, for these reasons and probably a few more the concept of open source email marketing has been practically non-existent. This is one reason why Mautic, and <a href="https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/">open source marketing automation</a> has been so incredibly successful. For those not yet ready to dive into all that marketing automation can do for them, Mautic provides an incredible open source email marketing platform. Previously we’ve looked at how you can <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/email-marketing-level-one/">begin using Mautic for level one email marketing</a> and just getting started. In this article we’ll look at a few specific ways you can use Mautic for your email marketing.
<h3>The "Bi-Whenever" Newsletter</h3>
Some companies send newsletters every week, some send them bi-weekly, or some even send bi-monthly. Mautic gives you the power to send your bi-whenever newsletters quickly and efficiently. Using Mautic for your email marketing means being able to track clicks, opens, bounces and more. All the features you would expect to find in an email marketing system can be found in Mautic. But unlike the others, Mautic lets you run everything on your own server, or <a href="https://www.mautic.org/integrations/">integrate</a> with direct email sending providers (SendGrid, Mandrill, Amazon, etc…) more on this later.
<h3>The Special "Offer-vent"</h3>
You may also want to send emails to an audience when you have a special offer or event you want to tell them about. Maybe you want to let them know about something coming up and give them a special invitation. You want to be able to send each person a custom email and make it a personalized invitation. Mautic helps you with this in two ways. First, Mautic has an incredible page builder and email builder which you can use to quickly and easily create beautiful emails. You can create these emails with an easy-to-use drag and drop interface. Secondly, with Mautic as your open source email marketing system you can easily personalize every email and yet send only once. Using email templates you can bulk send emails to you lists of contacts and personalize each one (automatically).
<h3>The Welcome Tickle</h3>
Lastly, you may want to configure your open source email marketing system to send an <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/the-power-of-personal-emails/">automatic (and personal) email</a> to those users who have just signed up or subscribed to your services. Maybe they bought something or downloaded something or just asked for more information. With Mautic you can have triggers to automatically send an email when a form is submitted. This is great for a couple of reasons. First, this email can be sent immediately when the form is submitted (everyone likes instant gratification), or secondly, you can have Mautic schedule the email to send later at a pre-determined time. Maybe you want to make them wait a day before your email them. Whatever the reason and whatever the time, <a href="https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/">Mautic lets you create and send the welcome email when you want</a>.

In this short article we’re going to look at **email bounce management**. This is one feature of email marketing and marketing automation that has been extremely important and one we recognized early on as key to our continued success.

### What is bounce management?

Bounce management in email marketing is how your email marketing software handles non-deliverable messages (messages that bounce from the recipient). There are a number of reasons for this failure and you need to be able to handle them when they happen.

Traditionally this type of functionality is very difficult to accomplish in a distributed software platform (like Mautic) and thus [open source email marketing systems](https://www.mautic.org/blog/open-source-email-marketing/) has been somewhat limited. We change all of that. Mautic is capable of powerful email marketing systems and now includes bounce management.

### How Mautic handles email bounces

With the latest release of Mautic a new section has been added to the configuration area. In this configuration area you can define the monitored email address, the connection details, the folder you wish to check for bounces as well as a folder you wish to check for unsubscribe requests.

![Mautic Bounce Management New Feature](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mautic_bounce_management-1024x698.png)


Mautic will read every message that enters those folders and parse it out successfully within your Mautic marketing automation software. It’s a powerful new feature and one that’s critical to a successful open source email marketing system.

Bounce management gives you the power to know and build your email marketing the right way. Knowledge is power and with bounce management in place you’ll be able to refine your email marketing lists, improve your send/open rates, and ultimately make your email marketing successful.

Remember, this is only one feature from the upcoming release of Mautic.

#### Lead Tagging (Nothing to see here)

Lead can now be tagged through their profile page, edit form, API, or tracking pixels. Search by tags, tag through campaigns, etc. To tag via the API or tracking pixel, append `&tags=tag1,tag2,-tag3` (prefix with a minus) to delete a tag).

In this lesson we''ll continue to create a Mautic plugin, but first as a very quick review, in our last tutorial we started with a basic introduction to plugin creation. Remember we started with **planning a plugin**, examining the **third party API**, and looking at the [developer resources provided by Mautic](https://developer.mautic.org). If you want to read more you can check out the [previous article](https://www.mautic.org/blog/how-to-create-a-mautic-plugin-tutorial-series-introduction/) and then come back here when you’re ready.

This second tutorial in creating your Mautic plugin we will start looking at the specifics of some of the files we’re going to write and how we take advantage of both the Mautic API and third party API calls.

### Basic Files

There are several basic files we need to write to have our plugin registered within Mautic. We created the files in our last tutorial and this graphic shows them to you again.

[![Create mautic plugin file structure](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mautic_desk_plugin_files.png)
](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/mautic_desk_plugin_files.png)

The files we are going to focus on today include the **config.php** file, the **MauticDeskBundle.php**, and **FormSubscriber.php**. These are the quickest of the files and so we can cover them quickly. The other files you see in this screenshot are more specific to this particular integration and they will be covered in the next tutorial. For now let’s look at these first three files in more detail and line by line.

#### config.php

This first file is the config file which Mautic will use when loading the plugin into the system. In this file we are going to name our plugin, provide a description, version and author. Then we need to define the services we want our plugin to use. Here’s the file:

[github file="/dbhurley/mautic-desk-plugin/blob/master/Config/config.php"]

**Services**: The services are broken into two types, events and forms. Events are those items which you want to trigger as a result of some action within Mautic. Forms are the functions and calls to run when a form is loaded within Mautic.

> e.g. Real-life, the form services will allow your plugin to collect more information from forms within Mautic from the business user (not the site visitor).

The Desk plugin that we are writing will need both an event service and a form service. We’ll dig into each of these services later but notice that the class defined for each of these services is the path to the associated file.

#### MauticDeskBundle.php

This file is the root file that can be used when extending the Plugin base class. In this plugin we do not need to extend anything so the file below is merely a holding file that routes everything to the Plugin Base parent class.

[github file="/dbhurley/mautic-desk-plugin/blob/master/MauticDeskBundle.php"]

#### FormSubscriber.php

This file is associated with the event service we defined earlier in our config.php file. This FormSubscriber is the event that gets triggered based on some action within Mautic. Let’s look at the file and then break it down.

[github file="/dbhurley/mautic-desk-plugin/blob/master/EventListener/FormSubcriber.php"]

Namespacing and used classes are the first thing you’ll find in the file. Here we define what we’ll be using or referencing later in the file.

This class, FormSubscriber, extends a CommonSubscriber class available for all plugins.

The public function `onFormBuild` accepts a parameter of the FormBuilderEvent (as you can see type-hinted). Here we define the action for this particular service event. We will create the group, description, label, formType, formTheme, and callback function that we want triggered by this submit action. Lastly we add the submitAction to the event.

In this array of actions we have a few special key-value pairs to mention. First, the formType defines the configuration or parameters your plugin will have as part of the plugin configuration fields. (Don’t worry we’ll return to this later when we look at the form service and the plugin configuration).

The callback defines the location and the function you want to be called when the event is triggered.

Don’t let the formType confuse you, at this point in the process, it’s best to consider this merely a way for your admin configuration settings to be added to your plugin when it’s triggered.

### Next Step

The next piece in the plugin tutorial will be to focus on the admin configuration for your plugin (see, it’s coming together) and then explore how the triggered response is pushed to the third party. This plugin may be a short series but will add great functionality. I expect after this tutorial series you will have no problem taking this example and building your own plugins easily to push Mautic data to other systems, the Mautic API is a great way to integrate open source marketing automation with everything else.', 'In our previous article we began looking at creating your own Mautic plugin to integrate a third party software with your awesome new open source marketing automation software (yes, Mautic).

How many press releases have you read that talk about the great things happening within a company? These are somewhat interesting but they don’t illicit any deep emotion or excitement from you as the reader. Why? Because they don’t affect you. [Drip marketing campaigns](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/), [email marketing campaigns](https://www.mautic.org/blog/open-source-email-marketing/), and your [marketing automation software](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/) should all be processes and tools you use to make your marketing sweet and sticky. Sweet and sticky…like honey. This is why we’re calling this the **honeypot approach** to marketing.

Everything you do should put these two factors, sweet and sticky, to work in your social marketing, email marketing and marketing automation process. Let’s look at what each of these two factors and apply them to your marketing plan.

### Sweet

Think about when we spoke in the beginning about **perspective**. Your want your marketing perspective to be focused on how what you are doing affects your target audience. Target audience is such a cold word, instead think of them as your friends. When you’re speaking with your friends you are sharing, you’re not often speaking *to* as much as you are speaking *with* your friends. When you change your perspective you sweeten your communication. Your friends want more. They want to engage and interact with you. You will find the communication becomes a conversation. Like honey, this is a sweet and welcome change from a boring, bland, press release. Your email marketing is not an email blast but merely a sweet start to a continuing discussion or engagement.

### Sticky

The second factor is the sticky factor. This is really where your drip marketing comes into play. You should make sure your marketing campaigns and your marketing strategy is focused on the long-term benefits and value offered to your friends. You are not looking for a one time “bounce” from a website visitor. Instead you are seeking to craft content, engineer emails, and lay out landing pages that draw the reader in to do more. Not just doing more but coming back time and again. This is the sticky factor. Drip marketing accomplishes this by providing relevant information at key points in time or at key steps in the sales funnel. You are nurturing your leads along a process. This nurture marketing is focused on being a source of continually engaging, fresh content for your leads.

### The Honeypot Approach

These two factors, when used together, create the honeypot approach. They engage the user through sweet content and they keep the user through sticky, repeated visits. When your drip marketing and email marketing focus on these two factors you’ll find all types of improved benefits. You will notice a decrease in your website bounce rate, an increase in repeat website visitors, higher search engine ranking, and ultimately a greater conversion rate.

Use your automated marketing software to engage with your leads at precisely the right time, your email marketing to keep them informed, and your landing pages and forms to keep them coming back.', 'Marketing from the perspective of the organization is natural.

These are somewhat interesting but they don’t illicit any deep emotion or excitement from you as the reader. Why? Because they don’t affect you. <a href="https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/">Drip marketing campaigns</a>, <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/open-source-email-marketing/">email marketing campaigns</a>, and your <a href="https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/">marketing automation software</a> should all be processes and tools you use to make your marketing sweet and sticky. Sweet and sticky…like honey. This is why we’re calling this the <strong>honeypot approach</strong> to marketing.

Everything you do should put these two factors, sweet and sticky, to work in your social marketing, email marketing and marketing automation process. Let’s look at what each of these two factors and apply them to your marketing plan.
<h3>Sweet</h3>
Think about when we spoke in the beginning about <strong>perspective</strong>. Your want your marketing perspective to be focused on how what you are doing affects your target audience. Target audience is such a cold word, instead think of them as your friends. When you’re speaking with your friends you are sharing, you’re not often speaking <em>to</em> as much as you are speaking <em>with</em> your friends. When you change your perspective you sweeten your communication. Your friends want more. They want to engage and interact with you. You will find the communication becomes a conversation. Like honey, this is a sweet and welcome change from a boring, bland, press release. Your email marketing is not an email blast but merely a sweet start to a continuing discussion or engagement.
<h3>Sticky</h3>
The second factor is the sticky factor. This is really where your drip marketing comes into play. You should make sure your marketing campaigns and your marketing strategy is focused on the long-term benefits and value offered to your friends. You are not looking for a one time “bounce” from a website visitor. Instead you are seeking to craft content, engineer emails, and lay out landing pages that draw the reader in to do more. Not just doing more but coming back time and again. This is the sticky factor. Drip marketing accomplishes this by providing relevant information at key points in time or at key steps in the sales funnel. You are nurturing your leads along a process. This nurture marketing is focused on being a source of continually engaging, fresh content for your leads.
<h3>The Honeypot Approach</h3>
These two factors, when used together, create the honeypot approach. They engage the user through sweet content and they keep the user through sticky, repeated visits. When your drip marketing and email marketing focus on these two factors you’ll find all types of improved benefits. You will notice a decrease in your website bounce rate, an increase in repeat website visitors, higher search engine ranking, and ultimately a greater conversion rate.

Some swear by it, while most, well most despise it. This leads to an enormous amount of blog articles, talks, and even [books written on the subject of cold calling](http://www.amazon.com/lm/R25OEL2YXG5RHG). Many claim that **cold calling is a waste of time**. But others consider cold calling, and specifically b2b cold calling can be the best way to grow your business. Rather than declare one group right and the other wrong let’s take a slightly different approach to the topic. First, we’ll explore 2 reasons why cold calls are a waste of time and then we’ll look at 3 reasons why cold calling is amazing.

## 2 reasons cold calling is a waste of time.

Many people hate the idea of talking on the phone. Worse yet, they don’t like to be called. If we are looking at cold calling we should keep in mind there are two sides to every situation. Just as much as salespeople don’t like cold calling, most people don’t like to receive a cold call. **Most recipients find cold calling annoying.** They don’t like to feel that they are being “sold” something when they didn’t ask for it. They don’t like to be bothered. This is a major annoyance and disruption to their day. But there’s a an important couple words in our earlier statement, they’re bold to make them quicker to spot. People don’t like to be sold…but they certainly don’t mind more information if they are actively seeking it. *This is our first hint which we’ll explore in more detail later.*

The second way that cold calling is most frequently considered a waste of time is from the perspective of the salesperson. We talked about this before, but most sales staff hate cold calling. Why this deep seated dislike for the use of the telephone? Mostly because **they find cold calling intimidating**. The potential for rejection is incredibly high. Humans crave validation and respect, the act of generating leads through cold calling is a dangerous and risky behavior. As a result, cold contacting random strangers is an intimidating and somewhat terrifying part of their job.  The result is clearly found in this statistic:

> “The average salesperson only makes 2 attempts to reach a prospect.”
*- Sirius Decisions*

When cold calling is this intimidating and frustrating the result is a minimum amount of effort put into following up and pursuing cold calling. It’s hard. It’s not fun. The reason is because you are doing cold calling wrong.

Let’s stop for a minute. We’ve now identified that most people don’t like to be called and most people don’t like to make the call. If both sides seem to hate the idea of cold calling why would anyone consider cold contacting a good thing? The answer is simple. **Cold calling has been improperly defined in this previous section**. The form of cold calling we have discussed so far is annoying and intimidating and unpleasant for everyone. We’ll consider this cold calling failure.

So, what is cold calling success? What type of cold calling is not a waste of time, resources and energy? What would be considered cold calling best practices? Here are 3 reasons why cold calling is amazing. But first, let’s start with a better definition of cold calling.

We’ll consider cold calling to be the act of contacting a specific, interested person with whom you have not had significant personal interactions previously. Notice, this is different from just picking up the phone and calling someone at random. Cold calling done right is amazing for three specific reasons.

## 3 reasons cold calling is amazing.


#### 1. Done right, cold calling is helpful

Unlike the cold calling mentioned in the first point, cold calling can be incredibly helpful. If you put into practice the definition of cold calling we just reviewed, then cold calling is the actually a helpful and beneficial opportunity for both you and the person you’re calling. The key to remember to make sure your cold calling is helpful is the “interested person” part of our definition. You are not calling random names in a phone book. You’re calling someone who is interested in what you’re wanting to sell (or offer). But how does this happen? The key is to successfully nurture leads before making contact. This not only saves you from having to perform the dreaded unwanted cold call, but it also saves you valuable time. You’ll only call those leads who want to speak with you already. You know they want to because they’ve been nurtured. This lead nurturing is best done through casual and continual interactions.

#### 2. Good cold calling is welcome

The next reason cold calling is amazing is because when you do cold calling successfully you are actually welcome to call. This is because when you know you are goign to be helpful (see above) then you can be confident the lead you are calling is going to be eager to speak with you. They will welcome the call because you will answer their questions! You are not answering questions they don’t have (i.e. pushing something on them) but instead you are answering very real and pertinent questions which already exist in their mind. When they start talking to you and find the help they actually need they will welcome the privilege to speak with you. Great cold calling only happens when the timing is right. Your calls will be welcome and your information will be helpful when the time is right.

#### 3. Following cold calling best practices yields results

The final reason we’ll discuss for cold calling involves the results you should see from following cold calling best practices. Cold calling best practices means taking the two points above and following them precisely. When you do this and stick to it you will find cold calling is amazing because it works. You will join the ranks of the many who proclaim cold calling is critical to your business success and you will be able to point to metrics that back up your claim. Examples like this quote from a recent magazine survey:

> “80% of sales take a minimum of 5 cold calls”
*- S&MM Magazine Survey*

You absolutely need to be persistent but you need to use cold calling effectively. You want to experience cold calling success; follow the steps above. How does this happen? What are the real steps to put into practice to follow best practices in cold calling? We mentioned them in the points above but how do you actually do these things in real life? **Cold calling success is found in marketing automation.** [Marketing automation](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/) is software your organization should absolutely be using.

The name might be confusing, but marketing automation is not just for marketers. Sales people who understand and use marketing automation will be far more successful than everyone else. Because, as we shared, marketing automation gives you the power to nurture visitors, random strangers, and generate new leads. [Marketing automation software](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketing-automation-is-not-scary/) does this through a variety of means which you can read more about elsewhere on this blog. The bottom line is this: Marketing automation takes the pain out of cold calling by making sure your potential leads are interested, wanting help, and will welcome your call. Now, when you perform cold calling you are merely following up on a lead that’s prepared and ready. Your cold calls are hot leads. All of this is thanks to marketing automation.

As you have learned then, the idea that cold calling is a waste of time is in fact not completely true. By following just a few simple cold calling best practices and using your marketing automation software effectively you will learn to love cold calling and your business will be better as a result.', 'Cold calling is without a doubt one of the most controversial and discussed topic in the role of a salesperson.

### Google Targets Ads Through Email Address

Google is beginning to let advertisers upload lists of their customers'' email addresses in order to target those people with ads when searching on Google, watching videos on YouTube or checking email on Gmail. Eventually brands will also be able to target people that Google identifies as having similar characteristics to the people in their email lists.

### Retail Email Marketing is Changing Gradually

Rumors that young people have abandoned email notwithstanding, most US internet users, young and old, do interact with email marketing. A December 2014 Listrak survey found that overall, 72% of respondents ages 18 and older opened and read promotional retail emails. When breaking down the results further by age and gender, the most likely group to perform this behavior was women ages 35 to 44 (78%), followed by millennial males ages 18 to 34 (76%).

### Ad Blocking Is a Hot Topic for Marketing, Media Executives

When Advertising Week kicks off Monday in New York, ad-industry executives will convene to discuss all the hot new marketing trends, from the branded emoji craze to location-based targeting to artificial-intelligence-driven marketing. But beyond the excitement over newfangled approaches, there also will be plenty of hand-wringing over the very future of the ad business as it comes under threat. In the digital world, the growing popularity of ad-blocking is the crisis of the moment, threatening the nearly $60 billion online ad industry. But it is just the latest source of heartburn. Marketers are also worried about piracy, fraud fueled by electronic “bots,” transparency in ad-buying and the need to ensure that their ads are actually viewable instead of hidden in corners of websites.

This process of finding your target market needs to be done with thought and careful planning. Why is this planned approach to your target market so important? Because if you incorrectly identify your target, if you’re off by too great a distance then you will be met with a failed product launch. Even as you build your business and create your product offerings you should be preparing your marketing. This means finding your target market should be an active part of your business development. Here are **7 recommended steps to follow as you seek to create the perfect marketing strategy**.

### 1. Think like your audience

You know your product. You know what you are working on or the services providing. In fact, you have been eating, sleeping, and breathing your business longer than anyone else. As a result of your personal involvement you have come to identify with certain terms, keywords, and a distinct way of thinking about your business, your product, and the needs your solution meets. This is the first problem you will face. **Rather than thinking as the person who has created this amazing business you must think like your audience.** When you think like your audience this affects your entire marketing strategy. Everything from the keywords you use in your content marketing to the flow of your campaign workflows within your marketing automation will be affected by the thinking of your target audience.

### 2. Go where they go

But let’s step back even further. Before you can think like our target audience you need to go where they go. You need to find those locations online (and on social) where your potential customers like to visit. There are several reasons why this step is important. First, by finding and visiting those places where your audience lives you will learn what interests and motivates them. Second, this will help you think like them (*see the first point above*). When you live a day in someone else’s shoes you have a much better understanding what they are going through, and what they are thinking. You must go where they go. And be mindful that this is not the same for every business. You may find a great audience for your business on Twitter while someone else may find that LinkedIn is their ideal social network hangout.

### 3. What does tomorrow hold

As a business owner and someone who knows their product and potential market you must do more than just create something your target audience wants today you must create what they will need in the future. You must identify how your market will evolve and do more than just provide a feature set or product that meets their needs today. You have to anticipate what the future holds. Henry Ford has been credited with saying something along these lines:

> “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.”
*More details via [HBR](https://hbr.org/2011/08/henry-ford-never-said-the-fast/)*

The veracity of the quote aside, the sentiment is true. Often your target audience is unaware of what they will desire in 6 months, 12 months, the future. Your job is to find your target, identify their future desires, and market towards this goal. Obviously this is a challenging task. While you cannot predict the future you should be consistently innovating and pushing the boundaries in anticipation for what will be required in the future.

### 4. How big is your audience

One of the most important questions you should ask as you seek out your target audience should be how big the potential market is. If you incorrectly identify your audience, if you overestimate the potential you will find your business is producing more than the demand and you’ll fail to be successful. You should look to well-known and respected sources regarding the potential market. As a business owner or marketer you are undoubtedly optimistic. You believe your product is needed by everyone everywhere. This is not the truth. Remember, you can’t be too cautious about believing your own stories. Do the digging, look at the cold hard facts. There are numerous reports and surveys carried out on most potential markets. Some of these reports may require you to purchase them. Do so. It cannot be stressed enough that you understand the true size of your potential market. Failure to accurately identify this metric will leave you standing in an empty room, alone, with an amazing but unneeded product.

### 5. How big is the room

In addition to the audience but somewhat related, you should also do digging into the size of the room. This means looking beyond the existing audience but the empty space where your audience may expand. This point ties the previous two points nicely together. You need to seek out what the future for your target looks like as well as how big that audience currently is. Then once you have this two metrics you can massage them to forecast the potential future market and ultimately the size of the “room”. In this case you’re looking at the negative space. Where will your product be able to expand and grow and add market share. Within different verticals where are the walls (or ceilings) what are the limiting factors for your audience? Don’t fall into the trap of believing your target is too perfect and beyond the constraints of any room - every business, every product has limitations and boundaries. Identify these early.

### 6. What does your competition see

If you are in a market where your competitors existed first you have a distinct advantage. Dig into their marketing strategy, their keyword targeting, their landing pages and their email marketing campaigns. Don’t blindly attempt to reinvent the wheel. Look around and see what’s been done already. You can gain an infinite amount of wisdom by learning from the mistakes of others. Just because you are doing something different, something revolutionary, or something never seen before does not mean there is no value in what others have done previously. Learn from what your competitors see. What have they identified as the potential target audience or what leads have the most potential. This is smart marketing. This is smart lead generation. Use the countless hours of others to better find and market to your target audience.

### 7. Plan smart marketing

This step is listed last because you should complete the first 6 steps first. While you should put a first priority on finding and relating with your target audience this last step is quite important. Once you have found your target audience you need to create a plan to market to them. This smart marketing involves how you create your [marketing landing pages](https://www.mautic.org/blog/landing-page-love/), the format and structure of your [email marketing campaigns](https://www.mautic.org/blog/email-marketing-level-one/), and the keywords you should focus on when crafting your [content marketing strategy](https://www.mautic.org/blog/understanding-content-marketing/). When you know your target audience you will be fully equipped to prepare a marketing plan that meets your potential leads where they live. Mautic has a powerful marketing automation platform capable of organizing multiple campaigns based on your target audience, but perhaps an even greater feature exists. [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/blog/get-started-with-marketing-automation/) allows you to test landing pages, keyword strategies, form conversions, and as a result better identify your potential leads. You should be marketing smarter. Mautic helps.

### What is Asset Management?

The term asset management has historically been used predominantly within companies keeping inventories of physical products. Asset management was the way these organizations tracked inventory levels, the availability of products and other tangible resources. But in the marketing world today this term has come to mean something a little less specific. **Asset management in marketing is defined as the management of a digital resource and the monitoring of all activity associated with that resource.** This means an asset can be any number of things: a white paper, a PDF, a PowerPoint, a movie, a spreadsheet, etc. These assets are not something that will be used up or spent but rather a digital resource your company wishes to make available to your target audience. (Questions about your ideal customer or how you should define them? [Read this article about finding and marketing your target audience](https://www.mautic.org/blog/finding-and-marketing-your-target-audience/).)

Now that we understand how asset management is related to marketing we can begin to look at how you manage these digital resources within Mautic.

### Assets in Mautic

When you use Mautic for your marketing automation platform you have access to a powerful asset management platform as well. Mautic helps you manage digital resources and track a large number of metrics around each resource. Sometimes the best way to learn is by looking at a specific example.

#### Download Example

You have a product, a zip file, that you want to give to your audience. You could easily just give them a link to a file and they could download the file directly. But when you do this you have little to no real metrics about who is downloading, how often, or any other valuable information about your download. Instead, you use Mautic, and your marketing automation platform, now the file is being tracked within your platform and you have much more detail available.

You may want to create a form within Mautic. This form will collect information from your visitors before they download the file you have for them. By doing this you are asking your visitors for just a little bit of information before giving them something. Your interaction becomes an exchange. [Read more about the process of building good forms here](https://www.mautic.org/blog/5-tips-to-build-better-lead-forms/). But beyond just the form aspect, Mautic provides many other helpful features. You can include your asset as part of your drip campaigns, you can create versions of your assets, and you can quickly see metrics as they relate to each asset.

### Square says its super-simple email marketing tools are paying off for small businesses

Six months after introducing square marketing, the company has data that shows its digital coupons increase sales. If you pay attention to news coming from Square, you know that it''s been a long time since all it did was process credit-card payments using its itty-bitty swiper. The expansion of its small-business services began in earnest back in 2012, with an app that transformed an iPad into a cash register. In May 2014, it turned receipts into miniature customer surveys and started fronting money to small businesses that they could repay a little bit at a time from their Square transactions. In April of this year, it launched Square Marketing, a service that lets businesses send digital offers such as discounts to their customers. And in August, it started to help businesses schedule appointments.

### Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice Viral Marketing Continues On LexCorp Website

An important aspect of viral marketing is making fans feel like they are taking part in the world of the film that’s being hyped, and so, WB has chosen to portray LexCorp as an actual entity, and it’s made for some entertaining moments and reveals. For one, there was the faux interview with Fortune that revealed that Jesse Eisenberg is, in fact, playing Lex Luthor Jr. in the upcoming blockbuster. This undeservedly caused quite a stir, as many fanboys did not realize that pre-New 52 Luthor was technically Lex Luthor Jr.

### How Arby''s Broke Its Marketing Slump and Became One of Today''s Beefiest Brands

The brand''s turning point arrived about two years ago. It was either going to crash and burn or rise to the challenge of its teetering brand. The difficulty was figuring out what made the brand special and what it stood for.

The team came to a consensus on what was at the core of the Arby''s brand: meat.

> "We''ve done that through creating engagement with our customers where the brand can fit into cultural events. We jump in where we think we have a right to jump in. We don''t push content and ads through our social media channels. We listen,” said Arby''s Restaurant Group brand president and CMO Robert Lynch.

### How Lego''s Marketing Vp Led the Awesome Team that Stole the Oscars

Though The Lego Movie, a fan favorite and $468 million blockbuster, earned not a single nomination in the animated feature category, the 83-year-old Danish toy company proved it didn''t need one. During a two-and-a-half-minute rendition of "Everything Is Awesome," dancers fanned out through the audience to hand yellow Oscar statuettes (made from Lego bricks, naturally) to the likes of Meryl Streep, Clint Eastwood and, most memorably, Oprah Winfrey, whose look of surprise and delight reached 35 million viewers. In fact, according to data crunched by Amobee Brand Intelligence, Lego dominated the night with close to 47,000 social mentions and 44 percent of the real-time discussion. That little Oscar trick handed the toy brand some $7.5 million of free advertising. Not a bad night for a loser.

Talking without listening: Pointless. Obnoxious. Harmful.

Pointless because you drive people away, obnoxious because you make your organization something people don’t just passively ignore but actively dislike; and obviously this is extremely harmful to your future success. This is not marketing automation. This is not marketing done right. This is applying old techniques to new technology. Your marketing automation is much more than a one-way blasting of information. You should not organize your marketing campaign to be constantly shouting at your audience. You must do more with your marketing automation software.

Marketing automation when done correctly can be a tool to engage and interact with your potential customers. You can encourage, support, and respond to their needs based on their action or even inaction. “But how?” you ask. Here are three quick suggestions to make sure you do marketing automation right.

### 1. Send Future Emails Based on Previous Interest

One of the most common mistakes when organizations start to use marketing automation is the ability to send unlimited emails automatically to potential customers. This is a bit like handing the keys to a high-end sports car to a first-time driver. The sheer power and awesomeness of this shiny new toy is too much to handle and things can quickly get out of control. Sending repeated emails based on too sensitive of triggers is the main and most obvious way that marketing automation gets abused. This is talking without listening epitomized. This behavior is obnoxious and potentially harmful. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t use marketing automation effectively and even for email delivery.

Properly sent and timely emails based on well-defined triggers are critical parts of a good marketing campaign. Just be sure to **listen** and build your campaigns based on user interaction. Did they open the previous email you sent? Did the click a link you shared in the email? Use these triggers as ways to determine interest for future emails. Be smart in your marketing.

### 2. Be Consistent Without Being Obnoxious

The second problem that can frequently arise with new marketing automation users is the over usage of lead touch points. This means contacting your leads to frequently. Don’t inundate your new leads with too much information too quickly. Remember that you want to implement a drip campaign not a flood campaign. If you bury your new leads in a torrential amount of welcome emails, request for feedback, product suggestions and more you will drown your potential customer. Don’t be obnoxious.

Instead be timely and be consistent. Set a marketing plan that properly touches your leads and shares information at appropriate times. This might mean a monthly newsletter with relevant information, or maybe this means a bi-weekly email with completely different content each time. This is consistent, friendly interactions instead of obnoxious and overbearing information dumps. This step also requires that you **listen** to your potential leads. (See Suggestion 1 above)

### 3. Don’t Hover

The last suggestion for building a successful marketing automation campaign involves trust. You need to trust your campaign workflows, you need to trust your personas you’ve built, you need to trust the process. If you don’t trust in what you’ve built and organized you will find yourself hovering over every potential lead and new site visitor. You’ll find yourself obsessing on what they are doing, and jumping in to provide more information and push a decision. This is the used-car-salesman approach to marketing and it’s ugly. No one likes to be hard sold like this; your marketing automation prevents you from doing this…if you trust what you’ve created. **Listen** to what comes back.

Marketing automation when done right will bring your best leads to the surface when they are ready to be contacted. They will be nurtured by your marketing funnel; adding points, giving weight, improving their readiness, until the time comes when they are turned over to you for direct engagement. Your marketing should handle everything else so you don’t need to hover.

------

These three suggestions will help you cut through the marketing automation madness and help you build a powerful marketing campaign strategy that will keep you from sabotaging your own progress. Be smart, Be consistent, Be trusting. And watch your marketing automation do what you intend for it to do.

Mautic is an [open source marketing automation platform](https://www.mautic.org) built for you. Mautic will help you organize your marketing campaigns, build successful marketing strategies, and nurture your leads effectively. Mautic helps you **listen** to your customers.', 'Talk talk talk. Talking without listening: Pointless. Obnoxious. Harmful.

Pointless because you drive people away, obnoxious because you make your organization something people don’t just passively ignore but actively dislike; and obviously this is extremely harmful to your future success. This is not marketing automation. This is not marketing done right. This is applying old techniques to new technology. Your marketing automation is much more than a one-way blasting of information. You should not organize your marketing campaign to be constantly shouting at your audience. You must do more with your marketing automation software.

Marketing automation when done correctly can be a tool to engage and interact with your potential customers. You can encourage, support, and respond to their needs based on their action or even inaction. “But how?” you ask. Here are three quick suggestions to make sure you do marketing automation right.
<h3>1. Send Future Emails Based on Previous Interest</h3>
One of the most common mistakes when organizations start to use marketing automation is the ability to send unlimited emails automatically to potential customers. This is a bit like handing the keys to a high-end sports car to a first-time driver. The sheer power and awesomeness of this shiny new toy is too much to handle and things can quickly get out of control. Sending repeated emails based on too sensitive of triggers is the main and most obvious way that marketing automation gets abused. This is talking without listening epitomized. This behavior is obnoxious and potentially harmful. But that doesn’t mean that you can’t use marketing automation effectively and even for email delivery.

Properly sent and timely emails based on well-defined triggers are critical parts of a good marketing campaign. Just be sure to <strong>listen</strong> and build your campaigns based on user interaction. Did they open the previous email you sent? Did the click a link you shared in the email? Use these triggers as ways to determine interest for future emails. Be smart in your marketing.
<h3>2. Be Consistent Without Being Obnoxious</h3>
The second problem that can frequently arise with new marketing automation users is the over usage of lead touch points. This means contacting your leads to frequently. Don’t inundate your new leads with too much information too quickly. Remember that you want to implement a drip campaign not a flood campaign. If you bury your new leads in a torrential amount of welcome emails, request for feedback, product suggestions and more you will drown your potential customer. Don’t be obnoxious.

Instead be timely and be consistent. Set a marketing plan that properly touches your leads and shares information at appropriate times. This might mean a monthly newsletter with relevant information, or maybe this means a bi-weekly email with completely different content each time. This is consistent, friendly interactions instead of obnoxious and overbearing information dumps. This step also requires that you <strong>listen</strong> to your potential leads. (See Suggestion 1 above)
<h3>3. Don’t Hover</h3>

	- **Markdown**. Grav articles have to be written in a format called [Markdown](http://learn.getgrav.org/content/markdown). It gained popularity among developers because this common formatting is used by many others, for example GitHub. This is actually a very simple format which looks humanly-readable in plain-text format as well. If you''ve ever experienced troubles with WYSIWYG editors, then you''ll love Markdown.
	- **Developer friendly**. Grav has focused on being the choice for technically-minded people from the beginning. For the longest time Grav didn''t even have an administration area. All administration tasks had to be performed in the code. Now Grav does have a nice administration plugin and over [70 other plugins](http://getgrav.org/downloads/plugins). Grav uses the Symfony framework similar to Mautic.
	- **Opensource**. Have you noticed we love open source? Grav is opensource software just like Mautic. It makes us wonder if these two projects were meant to be used together from the very beginning.

### Honda finds marketing rhythm

*Massive music effort targets hard-to-reach millennial buyers*

Honda, as it turns out, also wants to be cool -- cool enough to make an impression on the hundreds of thousands of millennials who pack the park for two weekends every fall. Hence the HR-V on-site and the massive Honda Stage it faces, where popular acts such as The Weeknd, Alabama Shakes and alt-J perform. Honda''s presence in Austin is part of a massive marketing effort that uses music to attract the fleeting attention of millennial car-buyers.

Panera Bread (NASDAQ:PNRA) isn''t the only company advocating for the ethical treatment of animals, but they are one of the first restaurants to push so aggressively against the common practices. By pushing against these commonly accepted practices Panera is able to generate goodwill with their target audience. That goodwill serves to bring in customers in much the same way as marketing expenditures.

### Easy Jet Shows Why Customer Intelligence will be Pivotal for Digital Marketing in 2016

It was a well-crafted email campaign, personalised and inspired by a deep-rooted understanding of the customer. A few days ago, I read a blog on the PPC Hero platform, where the author was mistaken segmentation for customer intelligence or insights. Customer segmentation uses conventional parameters like gender, age group, nationality, earning bracket and a few others. On the other hand, customer intelligence goes deeper to more unconventional insights like a customer’s motivations, fears, frustrations and deep-seated habits.

But this isn’t just click bait, no, this blog title is actually a perfect representation of what we should be focusing more on with our marketing strategy. Maybe you’re still confused. Or maybe you still think this is a gimmick just to get you to click a link. Let’s dig in a bit deeper into this particular blog title and see why it holds the key to a powerful marketing strategy.

### 5. Encourage action from your audience

One of the first things you want to do in your marketing strategy is to encourage your audience to take action, to do something. You want your marketing efforts either directly or indirectly to cause your target market to react (positively) and perform some action as a result of your marketing plan. Don’t think that everything needs to be a sale either. Some of the best marketing campaigns don’t encourage a purchase or a subscription but simply encourage action. Maybe your action is self-improvement for the audience, or maybe your action is for the common good. Action can take many forms and you shouldn’t be afraid to take the long approach.

Also, don’t get suckered into thinking every conversation, every marketing campaign needs to end with a revenue increase. The intangible aspects of building a brand and a following are very important keys to a successful marketing team.

Encouraging action and involvement from your audience causes motion and motion presents opportunities for change and change leads to growth. And just as you want to encourage this action, don’t be afraid to start small. This leads to the second observation.

### 4. Be focused on small wins

Notice that this title doesn’t say, complete this 100 item checklist, read this 1,000 page essay, and then create a 10 year daily marketing plan. Instead the focus is to start small. Do this one thing. By lowering the expectations and the “ask” from your audience you set the stage for an easy win. This is a similar approach you’ll find in the most popular video games. In fact, this philosophy is well-studied and has been the topic of many research papers.

Take any mobile app game these days and you’ll be sure to find this concept at work. Hundreds of tiny levels. Each one slightly more challenging than the last but each one providing a single, simple task or challenge. This is a perfect example of the small win objective. As you complete more levels you become more engaged, you continue to play the game driven by the motivation to win just one more level, after all it’s such a small investment of time and effort.

This ‘small win’ mentality will serve you well as you build your marketing strategy. Don’t ask your target audience to do too much at once. Be ok with starting small and setting them up for success. Remember that this wins don’t all have to end in a sale either. You’re working towards a long-term relationship.

### 3. Be positive in your engagement

The blog title says “to win” this instills a sense of positivity. You will be successful, you will win. This positive reinforcement encourages your target market to undertake the task at hand because you’ve planted the suggestion they will have a positive outcome. When you’re interacting with your audience don’t be overly negative or pessimistic. No one likes to be around someone that’s always complaining. Saturday Night Live portrays this perfectly with their “Debbie Downer” skit. Watch below and have a good laugh.

Wait, did you see what just happened? You were given a simple focused task, it doesn’t lead to any measurable outcome, but it builds the relationship, and this particular task ends (hopefully) in a few smiles. This type of positive engagement encourages and motivates your audience. They want to continue reading, continue interacting, continue building the relationship.

Don’t get carried away thinking everything needs to be upbeat all the time, but keep a good perspective. Keep your overall marketing message clear, encouraging and supportive.

### 2. Have a plan for your marketing

The final piece of the article title says winning at “your marketing strategy”. This implies that you have a plan. Your marketing must be focused on accomplishing a purpose. Don’t get so caught up in the immediate short-term wins that you fail to establish long-term goals. You don’t want to lose momentum or lose potential direction because you’re not focused in your goals. Have strong and yet achievable marketing goals. Create a marketing roadmap and set a course of action for how you will accomplish that strategy.

A marketing strategy can be quite detailed and involved. You should focus on defining key milestones, again focus on the easy-to-accomplish wins. Just as your audience needs to build their confidence through small successes, so do you as a marketer. You should devote your time and attention to accomplishing small and measurable wins.

### 1. ______

Now, you’ve skimmed this article, partly because you are looking for a golden key that will make your marketing strategy successful. You’re looking for the one thing you need to do to win marketing strategy. Here’s your answer, here is the one thing you simply must do and if you do you will win.

As a marketer you absolutely must **continue to learn**. You can’t sit still and stagnate. You have to read articles like this, you have to identify where you are weak in your marketing strategy, and you have to grow. Don’t think of this as a single key, but rather think of it as a reminder to focus on what’s truly important and to refocus on what you should be doing as a marketer. Learn, practice, improve, grow.', 'Nothing like a good blog title to get you drawn into reading an article. But this isn’t just click bait, no, this blog title is actually a perfect representation of what we should be focusing more on with our marketing strategy. Maybe you’re still confused. Or maybe you still think this is a gimmick just to get you to click a link. Let’s dig in a bit deeper into this particular blog title and see why it holds the key to a powerful marketing strategy.
<h3>5. Encourage action from your audience</h3>
One of the first things you want to do in your marketing strategy is to encourage your audience to take action, to do something. You want your marketing efforts either directly or indirectly to cause your target market to react (positively) and perform some action as a result of your marketing plan. Don’t think that everything needs to be a sale either. Some of the best marketing campaigns don’t encourage a purchase or a subscription but simply encourage action. Maybe your action is self-improvement for the audience, or maybe your action is for the common good. Action can take many forms and you shouldn’t be afraid to take the long approach.

Also, don’t get suckered into thinking every conversation, every marketing campaign needs to end with a revenue increase. The intangible aspects of building a brand and a following are very important keys to a successful marketing team.

Encouraging action and involvement from your audience causes motion and motion presents opportunities for change and change leads to growth. And just as you want to encourage this action, don’t be afraid to start small. This leads to the second observation.
<h3>4. Be focused on small wins</h3>
Notice that this title doesn’t say, complete this 100 item checklist, read this 1,000 page essay, and then create a 10 year daily marketing plan. Instead the focus is to start small. Do this one thing. By lowering the expectations and the “ask” from your audience you set the stage for an easy win. This is a similar approach you’ll find in the most popular video games. In fact, this philosophy is well-studied and has been the topic of many research papers.

Take any mobile app game these days and you’ll be sure to find this concept at work. Hundreds of tiny levels. Each one slightly more challenging than the last but each one providing a single, simple task or challenge. This is a perfect example of the small win objective. As you complete more levels you become more engaged, you continue to play the game driven by the motivation to win just one more level, after all it’s such a small investment of time and effort.

The other thing we notice is that when the technology is the hottest trend everyone wants to be a part. This leads to some of the craziest use-cases you will see. Let me give you an example: I noticed recently that the chain gas station down the road from my house has a giant sign asking me to like their Facebook page and to follow them on twitter. I think this perfectly typifies this technology-colored glasses. Why would I need to friend a gas station franchise on Facebook or follow their tweets? Now perhaps they have a very good reason for creating this social media presence and there is a real target audience they have created a marketing strategy around capturing. But my first thought is they have simply latched on to something they see as “trendy” tech and wanted to jump on the bandwagon. Ironically so I think since Facebook is over a decade old now and Twitter also is no longer the latest and greatest. But the pervasive nature of attempting to be fashionable in tech is clearly evident.

### The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Need</span> For Marketing Automation

What does any of this have to do with marketing automation? While the previous two paragraphs may feel a bit like two separate issues or topics what you will soon come to realize is how each plays a critical role in the current state of marketing automation and what I consider to be the technology trap.

Marketing automation at one point around 10 years ago was the hot new software technology. It had features and abilities that went far beyond anything else available at the time. Everything from email campaigns (sending emails over a specific time period), to lead nurturing and lead profiling were features found in this new and exciting area of technology. And customers jumped at the opportunity to try and implement this software in their business. Many were admittedly enamored by new and shiny technology and willing to suffer through the occasional bug or struggle with a hard-to-use lackluster UI. Fast-forward 10 years and you now see the overwhelming interest in marketing automation by all companies and organizations. Everyone sees marketing automation as technology they need. This is how marketing automation touches on both of the introductory two paragraphs. But what does this mean? Where does the problem lie and how does this lead to a marketing automation trap?

### The Marketing Automation Trap

[![planning marketing automation platform](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/marketing_automation_chains-1024x576.jpg)
](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/marketing_automation_chains.jpg)

In the first paragraph we discussed the trendiness of the software and how forgiving we were of new techology. But there’s a key word in that sentence. New. When software is new and when the company providing the software is active, listening and fixing issues then we are content to continue to use the software. The minute that progress fails to continue or the bugs in the software become persistent rather than fixable we begin to lose interest and become disgruntled users. Marketing automation has begun to reach that point. The existing software is now old, overwhelmed with bolt-on features and generally slow. Bugs exist for months without being fixed and users are becoming less and less tolerant of issues. This is the first marketing automation tech trap.

### The Marketing Automation Magic Tool?

[![marketing automation perfect solution](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/magic_fix_marketing_automation-1024x767.jpg)
](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/magic_fix_marketing_automation.jpg)

The second side of the trap relates to market saturation and a belief which tends to surround technology in marketing automation. Marketing automation technology can appear to be a glamorous and quick solution to increasing leads and sales. The idea that this software can be a magic bullet for increased revenue is overwhelmingly compelling. Every company at every size wants this technology to instantly turnaround their sales. But here is the trap. Many believe marketing automation is a fantastic technology that solves all their problems. The truth is much different. Marketing automation is a powerful tool to be used by skilled marketing experts. Please let me repeat that sentiment: Marketing automation is technology and a tool to be used by a business to accomplish a goal.

### The Mechanics of A Hammer

](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/hammer_nails.jpg)

> Here’s a simple analogy: think of marketing automation as a hammer. You wouldn’t buy a hammer and then expect a house to magically be built. You would expect to pick up the hammer and use the tool to accomplish your goal of building a house. But you would have to understand the mechanics of the hammer (duh, that’s easy!) as well as how to use the hammer most effectively to build a house.

Marketing automation is a tool to be used. If the technology struggles or falters than an alternate solution will be created and the market will shift to the new and the shiny new thing, in this case, that new thing is [Mautic](https://www.mautic.org), a revolutionary [marketing automation platform](https://www.mautic.org/blog/an-introduction-to-marketing-automation/) built on open source technology, powered by a global community, and available for everyone to use at no cost. Bugs are fixed quickly, improvements are constantly being made and the open source community means a democratized approach to new features and quick, successful, iterations.

Secondly this [Mautic community](https://www.mautic.org/community) is actively working to build an ecosystem of learning and education around the best practices for using marketing automation. You can use this community to quickly become knowledgable about how to use the marketing automation “hammer” and build your business.

## Mauticians

There are many different types of Mauticians (those amazing people who contribute to Mautic) and you can become one of them. We promise it’s not hard. Before we get into some of the specifics of Mautic developers we should very quickly offer a disclaimer:  



**Mauticians** are all those volunteers and contributors to our community. Developers and Testers are only a single of those types of people; and we as a community recognize there are many invaluable roles. This particular article will focus on how you can become engaged in the Mautic community as a Testing Mautician. This role is invaluable as you are the driving force to ensure Mautic improves, and becomes even more amazing in the future. Your time, dedication to excellence, and focus on our mission is critical to our success. You ensure Mautic is the highest quality.  


![Mautic marketing automation github repository](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/github_social_coding.jpg)


## GitHub

Everything begins with the code when you’re working in a developer role. With Mautic, we believe code is beautiful. In fact, we believe the code (that most will never see) is the most important part of our product. Beauty from the inside out. This means your first step is to become familiar with GitHub and learn what all it offers and does. If you haven’t done this before take the time now to learn about code repositories and online hosted solutions (like GitHub, Bitbucket and others). You’ll want to understand forking, branches, commits, merges, and all those other fun words. If you know them already then skip right on ahead to the next step. (And if you want more in-depth stuff you can research cherry-picking, rebasing, hashes, soft vs. hard resets, and more.)  


![Mautic Pull Requests and Issues](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mautic_issues_pull_requests-1024x637.png)


## Issues & Pull Requests

Once you understand the bare minimum basics of code repositories (GitHub since that’s what Mautic uses) then the next step is to look at the issues and pull requests associated with the code. This is where you have a choice. If you’re feeling especially code-focused you can read through issues find one that needs a solution and start writing code. If you would rather learn by reviewing other’s code then turn to the pull requests. In the pull request section you’ll find issues that other developers have already attempted to solve by writing code. Here you get to start helping immediately. This article doesn’t focus on the details required for getting your account setup and the necessary steps you will need to take for actually testing these pull requests and fixes. We will save that for a future post, however, this will give you a great overview of the different labels used in the system and provide a good high-level view of beginning this very exciting journey.  



![mautic developer labels pull requests](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mautic_labels-1024x797.png)


## Labels

You’re moving so quickly towards becoming a Mautic Tester! You must take the basics of code repositories, issues, and pull requests and put them to use. When you look at the list of pull requests waiting to be tested you will find most of them have a number of labels attached to them. These labels allow you to quickly see what status each pull request holds and what is required next. Here are the important labels you will want to look for:  



***Special Note***  

*One of the biggest challenges when working with a codebase like Mautic is the correct terminology and labeling system to use. Obviously an experienced developer may be highly skilled but new to Mautic-related code and thus is not a “new developer” but “new to Mautic developer”. We attempt to solve this with the following level system.*  




## L1

This first label we are going to look for is the L1, or Level 1, label. This label defines those pull requests which can take a relatively short time to test and does not require significant developer experience. In this way both experienced developers with limited time, and new developers alike can find and test these types of issues.  



## L2

This is the second label to recognize. This label L2, or Level 2, identifies those pull requests which require slightly more time and become slightly more in-depth from a code-knowledge and testing perspective. These pull requests may require additional items to be created for testing (e.g. campaigns, emails, landing pages).  



## L3

The third label we examine is the L3 or Level 3. This label identifies pull requests which require either a longer time period for testing or advanced developer skills. Typically this may involve things related to command-line interfaces, code modifications for testing, and third-party service configurations to test.  



## Other Labels



	- **Bug:** This solves a** **problem in the code which keeps Mautic from working properly.
	- **Code Review:** This is submitted code which may not yet meet Mautic code standards or generally needs community review before being committed.
	- **Duplicate:** Another pull request already addresses this same issue.
	- **Feature Request:** This does not fix a problem in the code but instead improves Mautic’s functionality.
	- **FR - Integration:** This is a feature request related to a specific integration.
	- **Pending Feedback:** This label is used when an issue requires additional details from the submitter based on comments raised.
	- **Pending Test Confirmation:** All pull requests require two successful tests before being merged. These issues require a second test.
	- **Ready to Commit:** This issue has been successfully tested and is ready to be committed.
	- **Ready to Test:** This is a submitted pull-request ready to be tested by the community.
	- **Translations:** This is for all issues related to language translations.
	- **User Interface:** This is for issues specifically related to the user interface or design aspects of Mautic.




## Go Forth and Code!

This is all the knowledge you need to start on your journey to becoming a Mautic Developer and a part of the Mautic community. We are excited that you have chosen to spend your time contributing here with us and we welcome you as a fellow Mautician!', '<p>Are you ready to take your code skills to the next level?

<h2>Issues &amp; Pull Requests</h2>
<p>Once you understand the bare minimum basics of code repositories (GitHub since that’s what Mautic uses) then the next step is to look at the issues and pull requests associated with the code. This is where you have a choice. If you’re feeling especially code-focused you can read through issues find one that needs a solution and start writing code. If you would rather learn by reviewing other’s code then turn to the pull requests. In the pull request section you’ll find issues that other developers have already attempted to solve by writing code. Here you get to start helping immediately. This article doesn’t focus on the details required for getting your account setup and the necessary steps you will need to take for actually testing these pull requests and fixes. We will save that for a future post, however, this will give you a great overview of the different labels used in the system and provide a good high-level view of beginning this very exciting journey.</p>

<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-1184" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/mautic_labels-1024x797.png" alt="mautic developer labels pull requests" width="720" height="560" />
<h2>Labels</h2>
<p>You’re moving so quickly towards becoming a Mautic Tester! You must take the basics of code repositories, issues, and pull requests and put them to use. When you look at the list of pull requests waiting to be tested you will find most of them have a number of labels attached to them. These labels allow you to quickly see what status each pull request holds and what is required next. Here are the important labels you will want to look for:</p>

<p><strong><em>Special Note</em></strong><br />
<em>One of the biggest challenges when working with a codebase like Mautic is the correct terminology and labeling system to use. Obviously an experienced developer may be highly skilled but new to Mautic-related code and thus is not a “new developer” but “new to Mautic developer”. We attempt to solve this with the following level system.</em></p>

<h2>L1</h2>
<p>This first label we are going to look for is the L1, or Level 1, label. This label defines those pull requests which can take a relatively short time to test and does not require significant developer experience. In this way both experienced developers with limited time, and new developers alike can find and test these types of issues.</p>
<h2>L2</h2>
<p>This is the second label to recognize. This label L2, or Level 2, identifies those pull requests which require slightly more time and become slightly more in-depth from a code-knowledge and testing perspective. These pull requests may require additional items to be created for testing (e.g. campaigns, emails, landing pages).</p>
<h2>L3</h2>
<p>The third label we examine is the L3 or Level 3. This label identifies pull requests which require either a longer time period for testing or advanced developer skills. Typically this may involve things related to command-line interfaces, code modifications for testing, and third-party service configurations to test.</p>
<h2>Other Labels</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Bug:</strong> This solves a<b> </b>problem in the code which keeps Mautic from working properly.</li>
	<li><strong>Code Review:</strong> This is submitted code which may not yet meet Mautic code standards or generally needs community review before being committed.</li>
	<li><strong>Duplicate:</strong> Another pull request already addresses this same issue.</li>
	<li><strong>Feature Request:</strong> This does not fix a problem in the code but instead improves Mautic’s functionality.</li>
	<li><strong>FR - Integration:</strong> This is a feature request related to a specific integration.</li>
	<li><strong>Pending Feedback:</strong> This label is used when an issue requires additional details from the submitter based on comments raised.</li>
	<li><strong>Pending Test Confirmation:</strong> All pull requests require two successful tests before being merged. These issues require a second test.</li>
	<li><strong>Ready to Commit:</strong> This issue has been successfully tested and is ready to be committed.</li>
	<li><strong>Ready to Test:</strong> This is a submitted pull-request ready to be tested by the community.</li>
	<li><strong>Translations:</strong> This is for all issues related to language translations.</li>
	<li><strong>User Interface:</strong> This is for issues specifically related to the user interface or design aspects of Mautic.</li>
</ul>

I used to sell all kinds of video equipment; cameras, routers, tape decks, character generators and more. It was during the mid-80’s when there was a lot of industry disruption. Jurassic Park had become a box office hit. It was a thrilling blend of digital video and 3D animation. More post production facilities and television stations were taking notice, wanting their shows to standout in the same way.

The traditional video and digital video industries were on a collision course. Many industry experts claimed that traditional Hi8 tape was better quality, and that viewers would be able to tell the difference and reject digital video altogether. Well, we all know how that story ends. Can you say [#netflixeverywhere](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%23netflixeverywhere)?

Today, almost all video is digital.

So what does this disruption have to do with marketing automation?

I’m glad you asked.

Some marketing experts would have you believe that marketing can''t be automated. We agree. Marketing is about playing the long game. It is not a finite activity. It has been, and always will be, about communication. It''s about the sharing needs and challenges, then ultimately listening and understanding them. We are all seeking solutions to our problems.

- Your toilet breaks.
- You search Google and enter the problem statement; “[toilet keeps running after flushed](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=toilet+keeps+running+after+flushed)"
- You scan search results to find an answer/solution/video that seems to resolve the problem.
- You then view the content to confirm the problem and proposed solution.
- You might purchase a product/service to assist in fixing the toilet.

For many supporters of marketing automation, this represents a huge opportunity. It provides us with the ability to make a connection and learn more about our customers around the world. Automation seeks to understand and connect customers to solutions in a manner that is efficient and user friendly.

At the core of who we are, we want to make marketing tools available to every organization that needs it. But what is a valuable solution without the instructions? This goes beyond documentation and how-to’s. It is strategic. We’d like to share an approach that we trust will help you understand the marketing automation landscape and determine how all these solutions fit together for your organization.

Over the course of the next couple of weeks, we’d like to offer our thoughts on how to assess your current state, further understand your customer buying cycle and develop a plan for implementation. All in an effort to help you customize your own unique approach to marketing automation.


## The Touchpoint

In today’s post we want to highlight the value of the customer [touchpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touchpoint). So many organizations today think that a few simple email campaigns will unlock the door to endless customer engagement and profits. This is simply not true. For your company to be truly successful you must learn that marketing automation is about understanding the big picture of your customer.

It’s critical in today’s marketplace, that you not only understand what customer need you’re meeting, but understand each touchpoint you have with them. During the buying cycle, there will be many times that you have an opportunity to create a meaningful, value-filled connection.

Step 1 of understanding how marketing automation fits within your business, begins with laying out your purchase/sales process and evaluating each customer touchpoint. We would like to provide you with a few thoughts to help get you started;



- First, write down the steps in your sales process from left to right. (Tip: This process should be cyclical. You never want to end the process with a sale.
- After you have identified your sales process, under every step, write down all the different touch points where the customer is involved/connected with that step. Does it involve contact with an associate? When do customers interact with your product or service? List all of them out. Even ones you think are outliers.
- Now you’ve written down each touch point your customer has with you and your product or service. There are a couple of additional questions that will take this exercise to the next level. Evaluate each touch point. Are you being proactive or reactive? What value can you bring the customer at each step that would delight them?



We''ve provided a high-level example of a sales process to get you started. Keep in mind this is a 50,000 foot view. If your process is more complex, there are likely many additional channels under each step that will require further evaluation.

## Don''t Go It Alone

You should not lay out this process or answer these questions alone. Each and every function in your business likely has a touch point and channel they are responsible for. Whether it is the cashier or the accountant, the salesperson or the receptionist, these touch points will provide you with a holistic picture for the areas where you can add over-the-top value to your customer, with the ultimate goal of developing a long-term relationship. To start you off, there is an [HBR presentation](https://hbr.org/2013/11/managing-the-complete-customer-journey/) that could assist you in beginning to see and understand the cumulative customer journey.

But outlining these customer touch points is just the beginning. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, the opportunities to connect with your customer will continue to grow. So it’s important to make each and every connection count.

Understanding the big picture of your customer buying journey, and the touch points that impact them, will help you assess the areas you need to improve. But before you invest in a marketing automation solution, it is important to realize that automation will not increase your sales, creating meaningful customer experiences will.

Stayed tuned for the next installment of the Big Picture of marketing automation where we will discuss how to outline your goals.

In the United States there is a particularly memorable television commercial series created by the marketing department at State Farm Insurance. This series tracks the mishaps of individuals at the most vulnerable moments of their lives. Specifically in the immediate aftermath of an accident. This is obviously a time of extreme stress, worry, and fear. State Farm seeks to demonstrate that their team of dedicated experts is always instantly available for help during this time. They show this through the humorous depiction of the victim singing the State Farm jingle (*“Like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.”*). Instantly, like a genie, the State Farm agent is present in the middle of the disaster. With a smile and a confident air they immediately reassure the person, “Don’t worry, you’re covered.”

## The Original

Since videos are easy to understand, here’s an example:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRS4shfH1Pw

This campaign has gone on for a while. Many are aware of State Farm, the genie effect, and the simple jingle that summons their agent. Then State Farm turned the tables on their marketing strategy and in a 180 degree turn they released a different commercial.

## The Twist

With no warning, very little giveaways, and a surprise twist State Farm released the following commercial.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HxznTayRCYQ

Clearly the marketing company behind this campaign knows what they are doing. In a light-hearted 30 seconds they give people an inside look into the other side of things. They imply the familiar jingle, the calamitous events, the subtle confidence. Rather than beating the audience over the head with the same marketing material they use humor and a new perspective to subtly bring their message to their audience.

## The Importance of Marketing Perspective

This marketing is a clear example of the importance of perspective and how to effectively market without shouting at the audience. When building a marketing campaign or planning an intelligent marketing perspective there is an important point to consider. Don’t be obnoxious. Don’t be so direct there is nothing left to imagine. Use a subtle approach to your marketing when necessary. And secondly, don’t forget the audience. Marketing perspective is more than the business shouting their message. Marketing perspective is listening and reacting. Marketing is giving an inside peek into a much deeper part of the business.

Great marketing goes into the soul of a business to share a deeper purpose, the reason why a business exists. Great marketing gives a better, richer perspective. Humor is only one way to do this. State Farm chose to take a humorous approach to a very real, personal, and inside look into the lives of their agents.

## The Relationships

There are two excellent points to take away from this. First, State Farm demonstrates the dedication of their agents to their clients. Second, State Farm does a masterful job providing an inside look, different perspective into the lives of their agents with a surprising revelation: Hey, they’re people too! These agents are willing to drop whatever they are doing in their personal lives to help someone else. This is masterful because in one simple commercial State Farm connects with their audience, demonstrates their dedication, their humanity, and the importance they place on relationships.

## Understanding Omni Channel


As we look at the holistic [customer journey](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/marketing-automation-begins-with-a-touch/), one of the terms that you will see is omni channel. This term simply indicates all the marketing channels along your customers journey to your organization. The typical sales funnel is being uprooted by new channels and processes everyday. Your customer may learn about your product or service by walking down the street, seeing a Facebook post and browsing Instagram, among a variety of other ways. Understanding this will help you see your communications differently.

Let''s remember that as you evaluate all of these different channels, consider how automation can assist you in connecting with your audience, gathering data about your customer, but more importantly bringing value to them. This omni channel approach should help you see your marketing differently. It''s time we begin looking at marketing not as campaigns or headlines, but as value creation.  


> "It''s time we begin looking at marketing not as campaigns or headlines, but as value creation." 

 
Now that we’ve defined our communication channels, we need to determine how each channel fits into the broader goals of our strategy. As we discussed in the [scorecard post](https://www.mautic.org/blog/automating-your-marketing-scorecard/), what are the critical metrics that you are trying to move and what are the levers (or channels) that will help you move them?

This activity should be done with each channel. Remember, engage your team! As you begin to outline which metrics are impacted by which channel, you will begin to see how each channel can be utilized to gain the traction you’re looking for.


## For starters


Let’s take a look at a quick example. Imagine one of the metrics on your scorecard is to increase awareness, and add leads to your CRM system at a trade show. As we review all of the channels you are currently communicating through, there are definitely a few that would be relevant. Social Media, Google & SEO, and your corporate website. These channels could all be used to drive awareness (among others) for your involvement at the show. The key is to now review all of [customer touch-points](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/marketing-automation-begins-with-a-touch/) and see if there may be an opportunity to drive awareness through them as well.

Now let’s consider how automation could help us achieve this goal. Here are just a few ideas to get you started;



- **Prizes:** Determine a "conference only" prize that when visitors visit a website landing page, they will automatically be entered in the drawing. Then share the landing page on social media to gather more leads. Be sure to note they must be present to win. :)
- **Deliver:** Bring value to your customers from the booth. What can you deliver at the conference? Think about your product or service. Are there things you can do to help them overcome their challenges in small doses? Be sure to scan their conference card in order to receive it.
- **Promote:** Determine what the conference #hashtag is and begin developing blog posts prior to the conference related to the topics that will be highlighted. Share these posts via social media and include the conference #hashtag and then direct visitors to visit the booth. You can gather their contact information and provide the value you positioned in your marketing efforts.



This example represents the front end of the customer [ buying journey. It is a relationship generator. What happens when you get that email address is critical. If you truly want to develop a deeper customer relationship, don''t keep asking for the sale, add value. When you add value, the process of marketing automation will feel invisible and you''ll develop trust.

Over the last week or so we’ve covered a large area with a couple of high altitude posts. First we outlined [customer touchpoints](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/marketing-automation-begins-with-a-touch/). Then we discussed the [scorecard](https://www.mautic.org/blog/automating-your-marketing-scorecard/). And then we highlighted the initial stages of automation. In our final post of the series, we will be reviewing the entire cycle in a visual that will assist you in continuing the dialogue with your colleagues.

## Big Picture


As marketers we can become so hyper-focused on specific goals, campaigns or initiatives, we forget the broader context with which they fall into. This big picture view is critical as we begin to understand how marketing automation fits within our business. It’s important to remember that our understanding of this view will enable us to make the right decisions on how to automate our processes and marketing tools.

Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve highlighted broader systems that your organization needs to consider as you evaluate the big picture view of marketing. It begins at the business strategy level, then works it’s way down to your [marketing scorecard](https://www.mautic.org/blog/automating-your-marketing-scorecard/) and goals. As you determine the metrics you would like to impact, it is imperative that these blend into your [customer touch-points](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/marketing-automation-begins-with-a-touch/) and not override them. If our customer journey becomes secondary to your goals, we are missing the point. The customers’ journey to your business is the windshield of your marketing efforts. It should be clear and unobstructed.


## The Roadmap


With that, let’s climb to a higher altitude and see the big picture landscape of our marketing automation journey. First and foremost, marketing automation is not a bolt-on solution. For automation to be truly successful, you must consider all of your marketing efforts en masse. Some think that a landing page with a compelling call-to-action is all their organization needs to integrate automation. But this is a shortsighted view. Consider our road trip. Let''s say it will require multiple days to get to get to our destination. If we plot our course without considering the climate, construction and traffic at each stop, we may miss alternative paths to help us get there in a more effective and efficient manner. What if it is quicker to go around the big city? What if construction is slowing traffic down?

This is true of your marketing automation journey. If we consider our customer touch-points and lay that context beside the omni channel approach, we will begin to see paths and connections that we may not have considered before. This is one of the key approaches to automation that often gets overlooked. The layering of channels and touch points is as vital to the creation of automated processes as content creation itself. If we don’t evaluate the intersections of the customer journey in connection with the channels we communicate through, our efforts will fall flat.

## Start Your Marketing Automation Journey


So now that we have a map of our marketing automation journey, where do we go from here? This is a conversation that will be entirely unique to each organization. We are extremely excited to have assembled a community of developers, users and marketers that have plotted their own journey’s and have committed themselves to share what they’ve learned with you. Mautic is unique in that this community cares about your success. This is not a profit game. This is a journey of connection. You see, when you win, we all win. Here are a few thoughts to get your marketing automation journey started.



- **Assemble your team:** As we’ve noted in previous posts, your marketing efforts involve a number of teams. As Macy’s discovered, Macys.com was having a significant impact on in-store purchases. The online team learned they had to work with brick & mortar and understand how the customer searches and purchases. 

> “We used have 2 separate silo’d budgets, we really now have one Marketing budget. And we look at the best way to spend that, what’s the best allocation, what’s the best media mix, whether it’s digital, offline, how do they work together to deliver…yeah of course the most sales, but really, that best customer experience.”

For more information on Macy''s teamwork, [click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62N0XOsmgU).
- **Understand your customer:** This goes without saying. When you understand your customers needs, you will be more in tune to their purchase cadence. You will know more about their buying habits, how they seek your product or service out and what tools/communities they use to evaluate. This will help you deliver the right value at the right touchpoint.
- **Determine the channels:** The channels which you communicate and connect with your audience, will be incredibly important. If your customers are online, than connect with them there. If they are in your stores, connect with them there. If they are in both places at the same time, make the connection seamless. Don’t tackle every channel if your customers aren’t there and don’t automate what you don’t have the structure for.
- **Automate with a goal:** You should never automate without a set of goals you are seeking to achieve. Automation should further assist your audience/customer in meeting their need. It should never be self-serving. When you deliver value, your customers will remember. They will follow you because you care more about meeting their need than meeting their bottom line.
- **Review and verify:** This is as critical to the process of automation itself. Always be testing. Always be analyzing your audiences’ behavior and purchase cadence. This is an area that, as marketers, we need to become more adept at understanding the information that is being gathered with every click, every visit and every purchase.
- **Adjust course if needed:** Marketing automation is not a “set-it and forget it” proposition. It is a complex digital conversation that grants you access to the voice and cadence of your customer. Your customers change. They are constantly looking for value in every area of their life.



Remember, your marketing automation journey is more about relationship building than it is about channels, touch-points and data. With every piece of information you learn more about who your customers are, what their likes and dislikes are, and how they desire to be connected with. Our job is to listen, and trust that we''ve provided value at the right touch-point, through the right channel and at the right time.

Over the last couple of weeks, we’ve highlighted broader systems that your organization needs to consider as you evaluate the big picture view of marketing. It begins at the business strategy level, then works it’s way down to your <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/automating-your-marketing-scorecard/">marketing scorecard</a> and goals. As you determine the metrics you would like to impact, it is imperative that these blend into your <a href="https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/marketing-automation-begins-with-a-touch/">customer touch-points</a> and not override them. If our customer journey becomes secondary to your goals, we are missing the point. The customers’ journey to your business is the windshield of your marketing efforts. It should be clear and unobstructed.

<h2>The Roadmap</h2>

With that, let’s climb to a higher altitude and see the big picture landscape of our marketing automation journey. First and foremost, marketing automation is not a bolt-on solution. For automation to be truly successful, you must consider all of your marketing efforts en masse. Some think that a landing page with a compelling call-to-action is all their organization needs to integrate automation. But this is a shortsighted view. Consider our road trip. Let''s say it will require multiple days to get to get to our destination. If we plot our course without considering the climate, construction and traffic at each stop, we may miss alternative paths to help us get there in a more effective and efficient manner. What if it is quicker to go around the big city? What if construction is slowing traffic down?

This is true of your marketing automation journey. If we consider our customer touch-points and lay that context beside the omni channel approach, we will begin to see paths and connections that we may not have considered before. This is one of the key approaches to automation that often gets overlooked. The layering of channels and touch points is as vital to the creation of automated processes as content creation itself. If we don’t evaluate the intersections of the customer journey in connection with the channels we communicate through, our efforts will fall flat.

<h2>Start Your Marketing Automation Journey</h2>

So now that we have a map of our marketing automation journey, where do we go from here? This is a conversation that will be entirely unique to each organization. We are extremely excited to have assembled a community of developers, users and marketers that have plotted their own journey’s and have committed themselves to share what they’ve learned with you. Mautic is unique in that this community cares about your success. This is not a profit game. This is a journey of connection. You see, when you win, we all win. Here are a few thoughts to get your marketing automation journey started.

<ul>
<li><strong>Assemble your team:</strong> As we’ve noted in previous posts, your marketing efforts involve a number of teams. As Macy’s discovered, Macys.com was having a significant impact on in-store purchases. The online team learned they had to work with brick & mortar and understand how the customer searches and purchases. 
<blockquote>“We used have 2 separate silo’d budgets, we really now have one Marketing budget. And we look at the best way to spend that, what’s the best allocation, what’s the best media mix, whether it’s digital, offline, how do they work together to deliver…yeah of course the most sales, but really, that best customer experience.”</blockquote>
For more information on Macy''s teamwork, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L62N0XOsmgU">click here</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Understand your customer:</strong> This goes without saying. When you understand your customers needs, you will be more in tune to their purchase cadence. You will know more about their buying habits, how they seek your product or service out and what tools/communities they use to evaluate. This will help you deliver the right value at the right touchpoint.</li>
<li><strong>Determine the channels:</strong> The channels which you communicate and connect with your audience, will be incredibly important. If your customers are online, than connect with them there. If they are in your stores, connect with them there. If they are in both places at the same time, make the connection seamless. Don’t tackle every channel if your customers aren’t there and don’t automate what you don’t have the structure for.</li>
<li><strong>Automate with a goal:</strong> You should never automate without a set of goals you are seeking to achieve. Automation should further assist your audience/customer in meeting their need. It should never be self-serving. When you deliver value, your customers will remember. They will follow you because you care more about meeting their need than meeting their bottom line.</li>
<li><strong>Review and verify:</strong> This is as critical to the process of automation itself. Always be testing. Always be analyzing your audiences’ behavior and purchase cadence. This is an area that, as marketers, we need to become more adept at understanding the information that is being gathered with every click, every visit and every purchase.</li>
<li><strong>Adjust course if needed:</strong> Marketing automation is not a “set-it and forget it” proposition. It is a complex digital conversation that grants you access to the voice and cadence of your customer. Your customers change. They are constantly looking for value in every area of their life.</li>
</ul>

Remember, your marketing automation journey is more about relationship building than it is about channels, touch-points and data. With every piece of information you learn more about who your customers are, what their likes and dislikes are, and how they desire to be connected with. Our job is to listen, and trust that we''ve provided value at the right touch-point, through the right channel and at the right time.

#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

So my background is that I am a young entrepreneur and I own my company that I bootstrapped. I wanted the challenge of creating something for myself. I have always run a little against the grain and I guess starting an business  was a bit of an expectation I placed on myself from a young age. There are challenges with everything in life, if there aren’t then it is probably not worth doing. Right now I am essentially a sole proprietor but do have a few independent contractors.  I am working with businesses that are stuck in the past and cash strapped. That means expectations are exceptionally high and margins are small, which makes for a difficult place to run a business when you are still learning the basics. However, the reward is that I get to build something that is different and that really hasn’t been seen before, and when companies finally do start working with me I get to see the tangible benefits to their business - that gives me a rush. I am really glad I found Mautic to help me minimize costs as it helps address the “cash strapped” issue with many of my clients. I learned about Mautic through Google and a couple friends who thought I might like the project. 


#### What is one word that describes you?

Inquisitive  


#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic and what is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

I decided to get involved with Mautic because I think it is a great tool and the idea of open sourced marketing automation just makes sense. The control over data and flexibility that Mautic offers was the largest draw for me. (Though, I would be lying if the cost savings over other tools wasn’t a draw.) I really like that the Mautic community is focusing on similar projects professionally.


#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

That I am go getter with a strong sense of reason and morality. 


#### What is your BAG (big, audacious goal) in life?

To be surrounded by people who matter and to not have the day to day stress most people feel in a capitalist society. 


#### What do you enjoy doing when you’re not working?

I love to be outdoors: skiing, biking, hiking, and I really enjoy cooking


#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

I think most people are surprised that I can be emotional.

#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

I am a Software Developer having worked with C++, Java, C# and a little bit of PHP since picking up Mautic. Over the years, I have transitioned to Development Manager role but still keeping my hands dirty coding fairly frequently. I came across Mautic by chance (thanks to Google) while doing research into Marketing Automation systems.

#### What is one word that describes you?

Positive

#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic and what is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

I''ve used an earlier version of Mautic (1.0.3) to implement a campaign for this company in the UK. I had to get really intimate with Mautic and started to see ways that the software could be improved which I would love to do.

The core contributors have done a great job creating Mautic and then releasing it as open source for others like me to use so I would like to contribute back to the community where I can. After all, this is spirit of open source communities.

There is a huge diversity with people (in the Mautic community) coming from different countries and with different backgrounds and different perspectives on things. In my experience, open source communities tends to have a heavy concentration of technical people whereas Mautic is different and fun to be in.

#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

Biggest compliments to me is when I deliver a piece of software that benefits somebody in the real world.

#### What kind of work are you doing with Mautic these days?

We have recently released a SpamAssassin Score Checker and we are having ideas on how to improve it. Beside that, I have a great interest in integrating other communication channels such as Direct Mail into Marketing Automation systems.

In my opinion, there have been a resurgence of Direct Mail in recent years when emails become harder to get pass spam filters and marketers are looking to Direct Mails to get their messages across.

#### What is your BAG (big, audacious goal) in life?

Get a pilot license. ?

#### What do you do best?

I have enjoyed running an offshore team of Software Developers based around agile principles that have efficiently delivered results to a UK business.

#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

Here in the UK, people often find it surprising that English wasn''t my first language and that I''ve had to learn it in school from a cassette tape.

Just in case you’re not aware, here’s the idea:

## Google Summer of Code Background

Each year Google helps to coordinate and encourage post-secondary students to spend their “summer” working in an open source project. ([Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/)) Google has the goal to increase awareness of the vast network of available open source projects in the world; give students real-life exposure to real-world software development scenarios; and ultimately create more open source code for the benefit of everyone. Successful students receive a $5,500 USD stipend which allows them to focus full-time efforts on their open source code project for the full 3 months. The entire program is done online and requires no travel.

This is the 12th year for Google to offer Google Summer of Code (GSoC) but perhaps even more importantly, **this is the first year where Mautic will be applying to be a part of the fun**. That’s right! Mautic will be submitting an application to be considered for the GSoC 2016 program.

Typically this is an extensive application process and requires a good amount of time and energy to be successful. Many applications are received and only a few are selected each year for inclusion. Due to the young(er) Mautic community some might think the Mautic community is not ready for such a commitment and responsibility, but Mautic’s application and GSoC project for 2016 will be lead by an expert.

## Mautic Application Leader

Chad Windnagle has volunteered to lead the Mautic application this year. Chad has years of experience working with Google and the Summer of Code project as a result of his background volunteering in the Joomla! ecosystem. He understands the requirements for applying as well as successfully executing a GSoC program and the Mautic community is fortunate for someone of his caliber to lead this initiative. The application period for Mautic extends from 8-19 February 2016 with** the student application portion being available from 14-25 March 2016.**

## Get Involved!

If anyone has questions, ideas or interests in learning more about GSoC or in particular Mautic’s application or focus areas please contact Chad directly at [chad.windnagle@mautic.org](mailto:chad.windnagle@mautic.org) for more information. (Hint: there might be a faster response found on the [Mautic Slack chat](https://www.mautic.org/slack)).

There will be more details, timelines, and suggestions shared once the application is received and accepted by Google.

The manager was talking about how challenging it was to keep team members from leaving the business. He was expressing frustration that some of the individuals that had left, were now back asking for their jobs back. And as they discussed the nature of their departure and return, the manager began talking about the culture of the business. “It’s not like it was when I was on the sales floor”, he chided. “When I was working the floor we did whatever it took to make the customer feel welcome."

The day was cold, overcast and it had been raining, and as the manager continued, he said, “You know, on a day like today, our team would have been standing at the front door with umbrellas, waiting for customers to arrive. And when they would, we would be out there asking the customers what they wanted before they event stepped out of the car. And if they did, we’d have the umbrella handy to cover them as they walked into the dealership. Now, the sales team simply stands at the front door and hovers, waiting for them to walk up to the door." 


> And if they did, we’d have the umbrella handy to cover them as they walked into the dealership.


He continued to express his disdain for the current sales team and how they have lost the hunger or drive to meet the needs of the customers who have come to their dealership. “It’s a different group.” he muttered.


## Why Automation


I think it’s important for us to do a bit of a reset on the purpose of automation. It has only been a couple of years since automation has really taken off, and already, there are marketers that believe automation can replace the entire function of marketing. They are like the sales team in the story our manager talked about. They have quickly forgotten the art of marketing. They have forsaken the customer and believe that they already know exactly what the customer wants, and will wait for them to “make the right decision”.

Friends, marketing automation will not, and should not, replace your marketing team. It was developed to help you see your marketing environment in a more holistic way. It helps you take into account the location and potential needs of your customer and help you provide information and value to them in a quick and efficient manner.


## Personal Automation


So let’s get back to our manager. When he was on the sales floor, he was always thinking about the customer. When the rain clouds were out, he was prepared with an umbrella, ready to meet their needs before they even asked. As marketers, we should always consider the needs of the customer based on their environment.

Where are your customers? What is their environment? Is it raining or is it sunny? Who are they with? Is it lunch time, are they hungry? The list goes on and on and on. These questions help us gain a critical view of our customers. When we see them in a way that is not a data point, but a person, seeking value, we will look at them and our marketing in a different light. Here is a [great article](https://hbr.org/1998/11/business-marketing-understand-what-customers-value) on developing a value-based model for your business.


## Time to Get the Umbrella


As you continue to seek the perfect automation tools to help you share your product or service to your audience, please take a long, hard look at your customer. They are the reason you are in business. Providing value to them goes beyond the sale. As we''ve discussed, you certainly want to maintain a healthy view of your goals, but if you don’t keep your customer front and center, your automation efforts will feel not feel personal. They will end up feeling like the car sales team that our manager talked about. 

So stop staring out the window, get the umbrella, go out in the rain and put your feet into the shoes of your customer. Because when you do, your marketing efforts will feel less automated and will start to feel more personal.', 'We’ve heard it before and we’ll hear it again.

Now, the sales team simply stands at the front door and hovers, waiting for them to walk up to the door." 

<blockquote>And if they did, we’d have the umbrella handy to cover them as they walked into the dealership.</blockquote>

He continued to express his disdain for the current sales team and how they have lost the hunger or drive to meet the needs of the customers who have come to their dealership. “It’s a different group.” he muttered.

<h2>Why Automation</h2>

I think it’s important for us to do a bit of a reset on the purpose of automation. It has only been a couple of years since automation has really taken off, and already, there are marketers that believe automation can replace the entire function of marketing. They are like the sales team in the story our manager talked about. They have quickly forgotten the art of marketing. They have forsaken the customer and believe that they already know exactly what the customer wants, and will wait for them to “make the right decision”.

Friends, marketing automation will not, and should not, replace your marketing team. It was developed to help you see your marketing environment in a more holistic way. It helps you take into account the location and potential needs of your customer and help you provide information and value to them in a quick and efficient manner.

<h2>Personal Automation</h2>

So let’s get back to our manager. When he was on the sales floor, he was always thinking about the customer. When the rain clouds were out, he was prepared with an umbrella, ready to meet their needs before they even asked. As marketers, we should always consider the needs of the customer based on their environment.

Where are your customers? What is their environment? Is it raining or is it sunny? Who are they with? Is it lunch time, are they hungry? The list goes on and on and on. These questions help us gain a critical view of our customers. When we see them in a way that is not a data point, but a person, seeking value, we will look at them and our marketing in a different light. Here is a <a href="https://hbr.org/1998/11/business-marketing-understand-what-customers-value">great article</a> on developing a value-based model for your business.

<h2>Time to Get the Umbrella</h2>

As you continue to seek the perfect automation tools to help you share your product or service to your audience, please take a long, hard look at your customer. They are the reason you are in business. Providing value to them goes beyond the sale. As we''ve discussed, you certainly want to maintain a healthy view of your goals, but if you don’t keep your customer front and center, your automation efforts will feel not feel personal. They will end up feeling like the car sales team that our manager talked about. 

So stop staring out the window, get the umbrella, go out in the rain and put your feet into the shoes of your customer. Because when you do, your marketing efforts will feel less automated and will start to feel more personal.', '2016-02-10 16:58:15', 1, '2016-02-10 16:58:15', '2016-02-10 16:58:15');

## The Team

The outcome of these engagements were often riddled with “a-ha” moments. They are moments when an employee would stop and say “I get it!”. The visuals provided a much clearer picture than a presentation filled with bullet points. But the visual isn’t born out of thin air. It takes a close partnership between the business strategist and the creative artist.

The development of these visuals always begins with the problem. It starts with the team sitting down with the client and listening to the challenges they face. Each team member hears the problem from their own point of view. These unique perspectives add immense value to the solution. In today''s marketplace, the collaboration between marketing and software development teams will become invaluable. This partnership can spark innovation and will be more powerful when they work together. And as marketing continues to move online, development must have a seat at the table. They will play a vital role in growing the customer relationship.


## The Collaboration

This partnership between the artist and the strategist is important. Even though their views are different, the goal of engaging associates is the same. Likewise, the collaboration between technology and marketing is critical. These two functions have operated in silos. They are focused on their own goals, without consideration for the other.

The collective reset button needs pressed. Teams should tear down their silos and realign on the purpose and goals set out by the organization. What is that purpose and goal? Creating seamless user experiences that add value at every stage of the customer relationship. Media buyers used to operate in lock step with marketing, and many still do today. They work together to understand how customers buy products. But communication channels are changing. Digital is now how we reach and connect with our audiences. Many organizations must work to help teams come out of the dark ages. They must forge bridges of awareness and understanding. 


## The Approach

So what approach do we take when aligning marketing and development? Marketing automation is a perfect place to start. These two teams must converge to meet today''s customer demands. Just like the artist and the strategist, aligning around the common goal is where we start. People would always wonder how an artist and strategist could work together. With a common goal, these two different views always produced incredible results. 

Let''s take a moment to reflect on the roles of marketing and software development. Although unique, they are two sides of the same coin. How does this collaboration work effectively?

- **Listening:** Strong developers and designers always begin by listening. Both these roles need a thorough understanding of the problem. This understanding is important before thinking through the problem and crafting the solution.  
- **Design:** Any approach to solving a problem requires a big picture view. This view reveals all the elements that may impact the desired solution. Trusted marketers understand the entire customer experience and likewise, trusted developers are focused on creating structure and order in their code.
- **Focus:** Good marketing and design requires simplicity. There should be one single theme or idea. Great developers create beautiful code that works well with as little “extra” fluff as possible. This focus removes clutter and aligns our efforts. 
- **Vision:** One of the most important elements that developers and marketers exhibit is vision. Marketing should take into account customer buying trends and consider feedback from their audience. Developers should also look ahead. Potential problems should be identified and resolved before they become an issue. 



This approach, combined with a common goal, will create more meaningful value. And at the end of the day, that is what we want for our customers.

Part of the application process is to present a list of ideas that, if accepted into the program, students can write proposals for how they would best bring that idea to fruition. The process is brilliant on Google''s part. Not only do the students have an opportunity to refine their technical, team building, and general communication skills; they also are able to improve and demonstrate their critical thinking to come up with a solution to a given idea and also their professional skill to publicly present it.

The team looked back on the feedback given from the community and came up with three ideas that seemed to be in high demand and would bring great additions to Mautic''s feature-set.

All of the following will require knowledge in PHP, HTML, Javascript, and basic SQL with emphasis on specific languages as noted in the ideas. It will help to have experience in Symfony and Doctrine but is not required.

**1. Magento Integration**

Magento is one of the most popular open source eCommerce solutions so it makes perfect sense that Mautic should be able to integrate with it! Leveraging Magento’s API, Mautic should be able to sync customer information as leads, track the lead’s ordering history, and detect abandoned carts.

Mautic should be able to use that information to segment leads based on products purchased, recent activity (i.e. placed an order within last X weeks or have not placed an order in X months), and order statistics (i.e. spent $1000 in last 1 month).

In addition to segmentation, Mautic should also be able to use campaigns to send dynamic emails that include abandoned cart products (with images) along with emails that up-sell, cross-sell, and reorder purchased products.

Finally, Mautic should have eCommerce specific reporting such as correlating revenue with specific campaigns.

**2. Custom WYSIWYG Editor and Improved Builders**

Mautic currently uses a combination of CKEditor in full-page mode for creating custom HTML landing pages and emails. It also has a custom-built drag-and-drop “builder” to build themed landing pages and emails. As much as we love CKEditor, it doesn’t meet all of Mautic’s needs.

Thus, we would like to see a simple, powerful, and beautiful UI for building landing pages and emails that doesn’t depend on the end-user knowing web programming languages. But it should still give the power user or developer the option to directly edit the HTML. It needs to support both “free-style” and file-based themes.

It should include drag-and-drop elements such as image, text, table, lead profile information, forms, and other Mautic tokens. There should also be a simple and beautiful WYSIWYG editor for text and a file manager for images.

Finally, it needs the option to add stylesheets and javascript files to the tag without having to manually manipulate the HTML. A strong design eye and skill in Javascript will be required for this idea.

**3. Javascript Tracking with Heat Mapping**

Mautic currently tracks website activity using a script generated tracking pixel. This method is limited to server values and whatever is appended to the image src as query parameters. Thus, Mautic needs a more powerful and flexible way to handle lead tracking using Javascript. This project should at least bring configurable page tracking (URL, title, etc), event tracking (clicks, downloads, video plays, etc.), and device tracking (device type, screen size, OS, browser, etc). Using the click tracking data, it would be great to include a heat mapping feature to see where end-users are most active on a website.

They are Discovery, Research, Moments of Truth, and Customer Engagement. As these buyer touch-points occur, it''s our job to create and provide as much value as we can. It is in these moments where buyers form their thoughts about your brand. You must help them meet their need by providing value at every point along the way. 

![value](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/End2EndAttributionV5.jpg)


Marketing and sales have a unique opportunity to work together to deliver value at every stage of the customer journey. They first need to align on the major segments of that journey. After this is agreed upon, they must align on the value that is delivered at each one of those stages.


## Creating Value at Every Stage


We’ve talked about the marketing/sales funnel and how it’s broken. We are in agreement that this is not where we have been before. So how do we know what value we should create at each buying stage? I''m so glad you asked. Let''s look at four typical stages along this customer journey.



- **Discovery:** The first area we need to tackle is when the buyer learns they have a need. Understanding this stage is a challenge. Start by asking your existing customers about what caused the need. What were they doing when they first discovered they needed your product/service? Where were they? This causal effect will assist you in determining the right content/value approach you should take. It will also help you understand what sites and channels are used when they discover it.  


- **Research:** We all do it. The data doesn''t lie. Research shows that we are going online to find answers to all manner and kinds of questions. And your customers are doing it too. This has never been more true even in the car buying experience.  




> Today, half of all car shoppers with mobile devices use their smartphones while at the dealership. The top action people perform with their phones while on the lot, not surprisingly, is confirming that they are getting a good price on a vehicle. Searches for Kelley Blue Book and competing dealers occur more often when at the dealership. - [Think with Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/five-auto-shopping-moments-every-brand-must-own.html)


These answers are the key to developing the value we seek to create. Learn as much as you can about where your customers are coming from. What sites do they visit when researching? Are they visiting your website? What content are they viewing? Is it valuable to the research they are doing?

- **Moments of Truth:** The buyer has become aware of the need. They''ve researched all the solutions. They will now enter the zone that we affectionately call the "Moment of Truth". It is in this space where your potential customer will make a decision to buy. Our job is to engage the buyer with the reassurance of their buying decision.  Sure we will have an amazing call-to-action. The button will be the perfect color and be in the perfect spot. But where is the value? When buyers make a decision, we must create the most value-filled buying experience possible. Is it easy to buy a product on your site? What does your follow up look like?  


- **Customer Engagement:** Now that the buyer has become a customer, the value changes again. It now becomes a matter of user experience and engagement. When was the last time you used your own product? What questions popped up? Was it easy to find the answers? What if the answers were sent before you had the question? It is important that your customer sees the value in a long-term relationship.




## Listen and Verify


But it does not stop at providing value. This does not automatically get you the sale. As any marketer worth their credentials will attest, you must always be listening. Each one of these touch-points should be tracked. It will provide you with the data you need to "listen" and verify that it is the right value being provided at the right stage. 

For sales and marketing to be successful, it must retool. But more importantly, they must align their focus on providing value to the customer at every stage of the buying journey. 

Marketing automation tools are valuable in helping you learn more about your customer. But the value doesn''t stop there. It can be assist you in creating a value-based customer journey that equips the buyer at every stage.', 'As a marketer, I’ve spent many years interacting with sales teams.

The top action people perform with their phones while on the lot, not surprisingly, is confirming that they are getting a good price on a vehicle. Searches for Kelley Blue Book and competing dealers occur more often when at the dealership. - <a href="https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/articles/five-auto-shopping-moments-every-brand-must-own.html">Think with Google</a></blockquote>

These answers are the key to developing the value we seek to create. Learn as much as you can about where your customers are coming from. What sites do they visit when researching? Are they visiting your website? What content are they viewing? Is it valuable to the research they are doing?</li>

<li><strong>Moments of Truth:</strong> The buyer has become aware of the need. They''ve researched all the solutions. They will now enter the zone that we affectionately call the "Moment of Truth". It is in this space where your potential customer will make a decision to buy. Our job is to engage the buyer with the reassurance of their buying decision.  Sure we will have an amazing call-to-action. The button will be the perfect color and be in the perfect spot. But where is the value? When buyers make a decision, we must create the most value-filled buying experience possible. Is it easy to buy a product on your site? What does your follow up look like?</li><br>

<li><strong>Customer Engagement:</strong> Now that the buyer has become a customer, the value changes again. It now becomes a matter of user experience and engagement. When was the last time you used your own product? What questions popped up? Was it easy to find the answers? What if the answers were sent before you had the question? It is important that your customer sees the value in a long-term relationship.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Listen and Verify</h2>

But it does not stop at providing value. This does not automatically get you the sale. As any marketer worth their credentials will attest, you must always be listening. Each one of these touch-points should be tracked. It will provide you with the data you need to "listen" and verify that it is the right value being provided at the right stage. 

For sales and marketing to be successful, it must retool. But more importantly, they must align their focus on providing value to the customer at every stage of the buying journey. 

Marketing automation tools are valuable in helping you learn more about your customer. But the value doesn''t stop there. It can be assist you in creating a value-based customer journey that equips the buyer at every stage.', '2016-03-10 19:09:15', 1, '2016-03-10 19:09:15', '2016-03-11 19:46:46');

Many businesses use the word free as a lure. They will offer their solution to us without initial cost, then convince us to pay after seeing the value of their solution. But is that truly free? We would argue these are trials, not free solutions. 


## "Free" Marketing Automation

Lately, we''ve seen many businesses offer “free marketing automation software”. But are they? Mautic is free and will be forever. But this is not a marketing concept. This is a philosophy.

When we set out to produce marketing software, we were compelled by our mission.  To empower organizations by providing powerful communication tools to anyone who needed them. Free speech is a freedom we often take for granted. To provide a solution that empowers free speech is an incredibly powerful concept. 

GNU Free Software [Definition](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) says: 


> We campaign for these freedoms because everyone deserves them. With these freedoms, the users (both individually and collectively) control the program and what it does for them. When users don''t control the program, we call it a “nonfree” or “proprietary” program. The nonfree program controls the users, and the developer controls the program; this makes the program an instrument of unjust power.


So while others offer “free” marketing automation tools, read the fine print. Because free for a month isn’t free. It’s bad marketing.


## Authentic Marketing

We believe in the concept of authentic marketing. Authentic marketing is about value and values, it’s not about trickery. When we have something of value, we don''t need shady marketing to communicate it. Marketing should be the artful way we convey and connect individuals to that value. So for our marketing efforts to be effective, we must consider trust as a key element for connection. If we continue to use trickery, we diminish not only our brand, but our value proposition. 

As marketers, let’s strive to be authentic in the way we communicate with buyers. We can’t be lured into traditional marketing schemas. Our values AND value must shine at every step of the customer journey. The Young Entrepreneur Council [encourages us](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2012/08/10/how-to-embrace-the-power-of-authentic-marketing/#124398e140a7):


> Don’t get trapped by marketing dogma. Think outside the box and be willing to take risks, so long as it’s in line with your philosophy. For instance, blog openly about the problems your company seeks to solve in the world and how you’re working to overcome them by fulfilling your mission.


Honesty, truth and conviction. When we communicate our values using these principles, it is authentic marketing. And the [data shows](http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/203540/unlocking-the-power-of-authenticity-with-millennia.html) it''s what customers are seeking. Let’s not disappoint them.

This represents an immense gap. Yet, it also represents an immense opportunity. Patients, like customers, are seeking to connect and find value. For decades, physicians and healthcare workers have been perceived as cold, calculated and insensitive. They rush from one appointment to the next, not taking the time to truly understand how patients feel.  Both in the physical and emotional sense.


> “There is a misperception among providers about how well they are truly meeting consumer expectations,” said Jeff Gourdji, co-lead of Prophet’s health care practice. “Although they acknowledge its importance, providers are finding it challenging to focus on patient experience in the face of so many competing priorities.” (source: [Loyalty-360](http://www.loyalty360.org/Content-Gallery/Daily-News/Health-Care-Providers-Struggling-to-Meet-Customer))


How many of us assume we are adding value at each step of the customer journey? Organizations and healthcare providers alike can track and close this gap. A well developed marketing strategy and effective automation solutions can monitor activity and create a more aligned patient experience.


## Patient Experience

But it begins with a clear picture of where the patient experience begins and where it ends. Each physician, practice or provider must see the [journey](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/starting-your-marketing-automation-journey/) from the patients perspective. And it starts long before the doctor opens the exam room door.

When this journey has been mapped out, there are clear intersections where the “brand” connects with the patient. Consider what value you are providing at each step. Where do patients go for more information? What pages of your website are getting the most traction? The most bounces? “But you don’t understand, I’m measured on how quickly I can get patients in and out and there are other priorities I’m responsible for.” Yes, this is true of every business. It may seem too simplistic, but patients don’t care about the competing priorities. They are seeking value, or in this case, the appropriate amount of compassionate care.


> “It seems important, then, for physicians to have neither too much nor too little compassion. Aristotle put this succinctly when he wrote that, as a virtue, compassion should be shown ‘to the right person, to the right extent, at the right time.’ He didn’t define how much compassion is right: We have to decide that for ourselves.” (source: [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/26/opinion/why-physicians-needright-compassion.html?_r=0))


The concept of marketing is making it’s way into the healthcare lexicon. Recently I received an email  from my primary care office. It was unexpected, so I opened it. It was a gentle reminder to get my flu shot. Wow, that was a well timed email campaign as we enter the cold and flu season. A few months later, I receive another email. Again, not expected. What kind gentle healthcare reminder might I receive today? An announcement that my primary care office is now providing “cosmetic injections”.

Talk about not knowing your audience. Epic fail. Simple patient segmentation would have revealed who would likely desire this service, making the content relevant.  


## Compassion

So it seems that the healthcare industry has their work cut out for them. They are responsible for ensuring all these important metrics are tracked and improved. And while doing so, exhibit the appropriate amount of compassion (or value) at the right time.

As marketers, what can we learn from this challenge? We are in a service-based industry. We track and manage many marketing priorities as well. But there is one thing we can not miss. We must connect our product or service and add value at each step of the customer journey. How?

Gavin Francis sums it up quite well;


> Compassion means “together-suffering” or “fellow-feeling” — a sense of identification we feel when imagining another’s pain. The word “patient” means “sufferer,” and at its most basic level the practice of medicine could be described as the attempt to ease mental and physical pain.


We must seek to understand and connect value to our audience. When we make this connection, we identify with the challenges they face.

![community](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/audience-547372_1920.jpg)



## Change Your Language


When we set out to develop Mautic, we started with an idea. We wanted to change the way people looked at marketing. We wanted to level the playing field for every business and help them connect with their audience in a meaningful way.  But we knew it was going to take a special group of people who felt as connected to the vision as we did. This is true of any brand. But it had to begin by changing our language. How often do we talk about "converting leads"? Whether we like it or not, we are conditioned as marketers to consider our buyers as potential leads, instead of individuals who are part of a community. It may be semantics, but if your brand wants to build a true community, you will see them and describe them differently. It will also change the way you interact with them.

Would you rather be considered a lead or a guest? Disney has built a culture and a brand that seeks to interact with people in a different way. It permeates their brand and the language they use everyday. In the book [Built To Last](http://amzn.com/0060516402), Jim Collins describes the terminology that Disney uses to build the voice of the Disney brand.



- Employees are “cast members.” 
- Customers are “guests.” 
- A crowd is an “audience.” 
- A work shift is a “performance.” 
- A job is a “part.” 
- A job description is a “script.” 
- A uniform is a “costume.” 
- The personnel department is “casting.” 
- Being on duty is “onstage.” 
- Being off duty is “backstage.”



These simple changes to their language reinforces the message they seek to communicate. It also greatly impacts the customer or "guest" experience. If you''re like Disney and your central message is "making people happy", you will not call your guests, potential leads. 


## Make Community Sticky


In their book [Made to Stick](http://amzn.com/1400064287), the Heath brothers reveal the key elements to making ideas stick. These core tenets are vital to not only growing ideas, but communities as well. They are: Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional and Stories. 



- **Simple:** If your mother doesn''t understand your core message, start again.  Your central value statement should be simple and easy to interpret.
- **Unexpected:** How do you get someone’s attention? You must be willing to do something that is out of the norm. How about giving away powerful software for free?
- **Concrete:** No business speak here. Your message must not mince words. You must say exactly what you mean, and mean exactly what you say.
- **Credible:** Does your message backup your value? How can people determine this? Are there reliable sources? Can your community test your product or service?
- **Emotional:** This often makes people in business feel uncomfortable. Research shows us again and again that we are driven by emotion or feelings. Don’t be afraid to get real.
- **Stories:** Who in your community uses your product or service? What are they using it for? Is it changing their life in some way? These stories will serve to further connect and fuel your community.



Mautic is filled with individuals who have gravitated to these principles. Leaders like Takuro Hishikawa in Japan, Rodrigo Demetrio in Brasil and even more in Europe, Thailand, the US and around the world. These individuals jump in and help others by equipping them with translated documentation. They gather their network to share common ideas and solutions. They take their free time to assist those who are trying to setup and troubleshoot. This is community.

Everyone who has contributed to Mautic has engaged and participated because they believe in one or more of these "sticky" principles. It connects them at a level that is deeper than simply intrinsic value. It’s a feeling.


## Feelings and Idea Flow


In addition to the key elements above, when a community is developed, it must not remain stagnant. There is a flow that naturally comes from collaborating with others as we move toward the realization of a common ideal. In the book [Social Physics](http://amzn.com/1594205655), Alex Pentland highlights this with the concept of idea flow;


> “Synchronization and uniformity of idea flow within a group is critical: When an overwhelming majority seem ready to adopt a new idea, this convinces even the skeptics to go along. A surprising finding is that when people are working together doing the same thing in synchrony with others— e.g., rowing together, dancing together — our bodies release endorphins, natural opiates that give a pleasant high as a reward for working together.”


It feels good to be part of a team that works together to realize a vision. This is not simply research. This is a physiological fact. When you feel connected to a community that is aligned around a common goal, your body engages. It gives you that sense of accomplishment, a sense that provides feedback in the form of emotional satisfaction. 


## The Right Kind of Community


We’ve highlighted some key elements to developing your community online. But we must be careful to grow the right kind of community. It is not simply a “group of people that share a similar characteristic”. This is more about facts and figures than principles and ideals. True community is a “feeling of fellowship with others, as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals.” This [definition](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=community%20definition) is what makes our communities sticky. Promoting this concept and designing an idea flow by helping each other achieve our goals, is what will truly connect us. 

This translates directly to how we market and sell. When we recognize that sales creates customers and that community creates advocacy, it changes the way we interact. We will make efforts to connect with them using a different language, on a higher level and with a common purpose. 

This approach works. Over the last year and a half Mautic has seen tremendous growth. We have used these principles to grow a simple idea into 10,000 communicators who have used Mautic and a community of over 4,500 individuals who consistently interact with and share the vision of a marketing solution that thinks differently. 

As you seek to reach your audience and develop your brand, what are other principles you’ve discovered to help your community grow? Share them in the comments below!', 'As marketers we are continually seeking ways to reach and connect with our audience. But more than that, we want community. Community is more than simply a group of buyers. Community seeks to connect with your brand. They believe in the central idea or core value proposition you offer, and want to share it with others.

Everyone who has contributed to Mautic has engaged and participated because they believe in one or more of these "sticky" principles. It connects them at a level that is deeper than simply intrinsic value. It’s a feeling.

<h2>Feelings and Idea Flow</h2>

In addition to the key elements above, when a community is developed, it must not remain stagnant. There is a flow that naturally comes from collaborating with others as we move toward the realization of a common ideal. In the book <a href="http://amzn.com/1594205655">Social Physics</a>, Alex Pentland highlights this with the concept of idea flow;

<blockquote>“Synchronization and uniformity of idea flow within a group is critical: When an overwhelming majority seem ready to adopt a new idea, this convinces even the skeptics to go along. A surprising finding is that when people are working together doing the same thing in synchrony with others— e.g., rowing together, dancing together — our bodies release endorphins, natural opiates that give a pleasant high as a reward for working together.”</blockquote>

It feels good to be part of a team that works together to realize a vision. This is not simply research. This is a physiological fact. When you feel connected to a community that is aligned around a common goal, your body engages. It gives you that sense of accomplishment, a sense that provides feedback in the form of emotional satisfaction. 

<h2>The Right Kind of Community</h2>

We’ve highlighted some key elements to developing your community online. But we must be careful to grow the right kind of community. It is not simply a “group of people that share a similar characteristic”. This is more about facts and figures than principles and ideals. True community is a “feeling of fellowship with others, as a result of sharing common attitudes, interests, and goals.” This <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=community%20definition">definition</a> is what makes our communities sticky. Promoting this concept and designing an idea flow by helping each other achieve our goals, is what will truly connect us. 

This translates directly to how we market and sell. When we recognize that sales creates customers and that community creates advocacy, it changes the way we interact. We will make efforts to connect with them using a different language, on a higher level and with a common purpose. 

This approach works. Over the last year and a half Mautic has seen tremendous growth. We have used these principles to grow a simple idea into 10,000 communicators who have used Mautic and a community of over 4,500 individuals who consistently interact with and share the vision of a marketing solution that thinks differently.

## Undeliverable Email


But is our email marketing campaign being received? So many articles (like this) have been written to help us get our emails where they need to go. Unfortunately reaching the inbox is now more challenging than it has ever been. According to [Return Path](https://returnpath.com/downloads/2015-deliverability-benchmark-report/);


> Regardless of the reason, declining inbox placement rates represent a serious concern for marketers. With one out of every five emails failing to land in the inbox, brands are missing out on a full 20% of their opportunities to connect with customers and earn their business.


There are many factors that impact whether our information/offer will get to our intended audience. SendGrid outlines [four key components](https://sendgrid.com/blog/4-factors-affect-email-deliverability/) to determine if your email marketing campaign will be delivered. They are;



- Message Infrastructure Health
- Message Content
- Sender History and Filtering
- Receiving System’s Availability



Interestingly enough, you can impact 3/4 of these factors. Can you guess which ones? The only item that is truly out of your control is the receiving system’s availability. All other elements you have the ability to impact or control. It’s not by manipulating spam filters or blasting out 5 times as many emails in one week to gain a better return. 


## Greater Email Marketing Campaign Returns


So how do we capitalize on the missing 20% and maximize the existing 80%? I’m glad you asked. There are many tactics that will help you achieve this end. But this post is not your typical how-to. I’d like to step back a moment and look at an approach that will guide your email marketing strategy.

The [2015 Deliverability Benchmark Report](https://returnpath.com/downloads/2015-deliverability-benchmark-report/) produced by Return Path, states that the greatest email delivery rate was achieved by industries that relied the heaviest on customer relationships. Think about that for a moment. The greatest returns are not achieved by the best technology, the most creative campaigns, or the highest budget. These results were due to the development of deep customer relationships.

So if the key to getting your email marketing campaign delivered is deep customer relationships, how do we foster them? As we connect with our customers and influence our buyers via email, we must consider the following elements to effectively reach them. 



- **Trust:** We know that all relationships are built on trust. Why is it so difficult to realize? Because trust is developed over time and requires many interactions. It requires patience. Industries like retail, health & beauty and apparel achieve stronger placement because they are typically high-touch environments. Real interactions with real people provide greater levels of trust. If you want to connect with your audience, humanize your interactions. Make it personal. Understand the need in the context of their environment, and deliver value in a meaningful way. John Kottcamp says it best;  



> Companies that excel at delivering rich, personalized online experiences not only produce more loyal customers but also outperform their competition on the stock market, according to a recent five-year study conducted by Forrester Research. (source: [MarketingProfs](http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2012/9484/humanizing-the-web-with-personalization-20-three-tips-to-get-started))


Personalized means more than tagging a first name in the greeting. It means gaining a deeper understanding of where they have visited, what their interests are, and connecting your value to that information in an authentic, meaningful way. 

- **Analysis:** Developing trust in a relationship is like strengthening a bridge between you and your customer. It starts on shaky ground and then begins to gain strength as you continue to provide value according to their need in the moment. As you interact with your customer, it is important that you never stop listening. Listening or analyzing the feedback they provide in the form of interactions with you and your brand. This requires time and talent. The proper analysis of traffic and customer data will further ensure that you are a trusted provider. Data is a double-edged sword. It can make you a relevant star, or it can make your brand feel disconnected and irrelevant. Which leads us to our final point.

- **Relevance:** I was at the local coffee shop the other day, chatting with a friend. We were having a discussion about how many vacationers were stopping in. A gentleman overheard our conversation and tried to make a joke, but it turned out to be an awkward moment as we didn’t understand what he was referring to. This was not about his joke, but about the fact that in that moment we could not relate what he was saying to our conversation. This made his joke awkward and irrelevant. The point is, if you want to develop trust with your audience, you must be able to relate to them in the proper context.  



> “Achieving such personalization requires knowing deep context: not just a customer''s demographic data but also the time and location she accessed content, the search terms she used to find it, the referring site that directed her toward it, and—most important—her behavior before, during, and after consuming it…” (source: [John Kottenkamp](http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2012/9484/humanizing-the-web-with-personalization-20-three-tips-to-get-started))




This approach works. Maximizing each email marketing campaign begins with content that builds trust, is built on proper analysis and is relevant to the customer. 


> Relevancy is the marketer’s secret weapon, and the fastest path to revenue. Emails with personalized subject lines are 26% more likely to be opened and marketers have found a 760% increase in email revenue from segmented campaigns. (source: Campaign Source)


In summary, the ability to deliver your email marketing campaign is not based on whether you can sidestep spam filters. It is in your ability to develop trust with your customers. If you can not do this with confidence, take the time you need to develop your marketing and communication strategy with these important elements at the helm.

These recommendations are simply the tip of the iceberg. What are other ways you''ve discovered help your email marketing campaign get delivered?

I recently attended a Salesforce event in Boston. Though I am not a customer, partner or vendor of Salesforce, I like to attend their conferences, because they are more about current technology trends than they are about the CRM tool. They told many great stories about how companies are changing the world by leveraging new technology trends. The trick to really understanding how to apply these learnings to your organization is to think about what you are trying to achieve. Ensure you are not using these shiny new technologies just because they are cool or because everyone else is using them.


## The goal of marketing remains the same

My first takeaway was that the end goal of what marketing as a function is trying to achieve  has not changed at all. People want to buy from companies they trust. The goal of marketing is to build trust with potential customers and maintain that feeling of trust with existing customers.

Before the dawn of the digital age, word of mouth was the most popular method that people used to decide what to buy and from whom. Existing customers served as trusted advisors for potential new customers.  Building trust is the way that companies sell to and keep their customers today as well.


## Then what has changed?

What is different today, is that now there is so much information and so many ways to get that information, that it becomes hard for the customer to figure out what is true and who to trust. An interesting statistic that was shared at the event was that 90% of the world’s data has been created in the last 12 months.

In addition, the buyer could search for information on the Internet or receive information from companies in the forms of emails, SMS messages, notifications through the website, messages on Facebook, Twitter and many other ways. They could also search or receive these messages on their desktops, laptops, iPads, mobile phones or smart watches.

It is the responsibility of companies today to help the buyer cut through the noise and consume the information that is relevant to them and helps them figure out what product or service will best meet their need. The challenge or opportunity, depending on how you look at it, is how do companies leverage all this data and these different technologies to deliver relevant messages to people through their preferred way of receiving them? The focus should be to begin building this trust with potential buyers and existing customers by making them feel like they have a 1 on 1 relationship with the company.

## What technology trends can help you do this?

The 5 key technology trends that were the underlying theme of most sessions at the event were:


	- **Cloud** - In the [State Of The Cloud report](https://www.rightscale.com/lp/state-of-the-cloud) by RightScale, 95% of the enterprise organizations that were surveyed used cloud technologies. What that tells me is that IT organizations are moving away from managing hardware to managing software. The availability of applications in the the cloud has raised the bar for performance, stability and time to market for new functionality. This has leveled the playing field to some extent as similar capabilities could be available to companies to use as they try to sell to, service and keep their customers.
	- **Mobile** - Technology companies have been talking about making their tools available on a mobile device for some time now. What is new is that they are now talking about mobile first and mobile only. [Techcrunch predicts](http://techcrunch.com/2015/06/02/6-1b-smartphone-users-globally-by-2020-overtaking-basic-fixed-phone-subscriptions/) that by 2020 there will be 6.1B smart phones in the world. Compare this to the [projected population](http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/) in the world in 2020 at 7.7B people. A large number of the smart phones will be the only devices people use to run their lives and their business. This makes it all the more important to figure out how to build products that are easy to use on a mobile device and also build those relationships with potential buyers and existing customers using this device.
	- **Social** - Human beings are social and want to be part of a community.  Though communities have been around forever - the difference now is that they are online. Social is nothing but an online community - the size of which is controlled by the individual. Social is both an outbound messaging channel so companies can deliver targeted messages using Facebook or Twitter; and it is also a data source to get to better know your buyer. Social is no longer just a marketing channel but it has also become a place where companies can service their customers and sell additional products to existing customers.
	- **Data Science** - [Vcloudnews states](http://www.vcloudnews.com/every-day-big-data-statistics-2-5-quintillion-bytes-of-data-created-daily/) that every day 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created online. What does that even mean? The challenge is making sense of this data so that companies can use the data to better understand their buyers.  This  is in fact a science, because if analyzed and leveraged correctly companies can create superior, personalized experiences for their potential buyers and existing customers which will undoubtedly lead to more business for the company.
	- **IoT** - My definition of IoT or the Internet of things is the ability for a device to record an activity and trigger a communication when a certain condition is met. Companies have only started to scratch the surface on the use cases for this. The concept of devices triggering actions has been around for a long time - e.g. a thermostat that turns off the heat when a certain temperature is reached; but what is different about IoT is the ability for the device to trigger a communication that can be accessed on a variety of devices when something happens.


Some companies get excited about the potential that these new technologies offer, others are overwhelmed and not sure how to best leverage these. What is important to keep in mind is the end goal - building trust through a personalized and superior experience. Use only those technologies that help you  achieve that objective. Remember, at the end of the day, these technology trends simply equip us, and it''s really the relationship with your customer that matters.', '<img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/smart-watch-821565_1920.jpg" alt="technology trends" width="1465" height="672" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1827" />

This makes it all the more important to figure out how to build products that are easy to use on a mobile device and also build those relationships with potential buyers and existing customers using this device.</li>
	<li><strong>Social</strong> - Human beings are social and want to be part of a community.  Though communities have been around forever - the difference now is that they are online. Social is nothing but an online community - the size of which is controlled by the individual. Social is both an outbound messaging channel so companies can deliver targeted messages using Facebook or Twitter; and it is also a data source to get to better know your buyer. Social is no longer just a marketing channel but it has also become a place where companies can service their customers and sell additional products to existing customers.</li>
	<li><strong>Data Science</strong> - <a href="http://www.vcloudnews.com/every-day-big-data-statistics-2-5-quintillion-bytes-of-data-created-daily/">Vcloudnews states</a> that every day 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created online. What does that even mean? The challenge is making sense of this data so that companies can use the data to better understand their buyers.  This  is in fact a science, because if analyzed and leveraged correctly companies can create superior, personalized experiences for their potential buyers and existing customers which will undoubtedly lead to more business for the company.</li>
	<li><strong>IoT</strong> - My definition of IoT or the Internet of things is the ability for a device to record an activity and trigger a communication when a certain condition is met. Companies have only started to scratch the surface on the use cases for this. The concept of devices triggering actions has been around for a long time - e.g. a thermostat that turns off the heat when a certain temperature is reached; but what is different about IoT is the ability for the device to trigger a communication that can be accessed on a variety of devices when something happens.</li>
</ul>
Some companies get excited about the potential that these new technologies offer, others are overwhelmed and not sure how to best leverage these. What is important to keep in mind is the end goal - building trust through a personalized and superior experience. Use only those technologies that help you  achieve that objective. Remember, at the end of the day, these technology trends simply equip us, and it''s really the relationship with your customer that matters.', '2016-04-12 15:08:24', 1, '2016-04-12 15:08:24', '2016-04-12 15:14:48');

We love finding and featuring our amazing community members who are doing amazing things for Mautic.  

   


#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

I am CTO of Facet Interactive and we have been building a team around delivering marketing intelligence services. For the past 8 years I''ve been working with Drupal, and more recently have started working with some clients in marketing automation and marketing strategy role. As we got up to speed on marketing automation, being from the Drupal world I started looking for something similarly Open Source, and was happy to find Mautic.org.


#### What is one word that describes you?

Hungry


#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic and what is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

I started by joining the Mautic Slack, and simply wanted to learn as much as I could. After getting a feel for the community after a few weeks, whenever I felt like I had even a rough idea about a potential solution—I''d share it. I''m always interested in solving the problem by introducing a specific use case or methodology. I''ve noticed that often times, you can get stuck trying to use an application in a specific way _that you expect to "just work" based on previous experience_, but often times we have to challenge these preconceptions.


#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

"I want to be like you when I grow up." —someone older than me


#### What is your BAG (big, audacious goal) in life?

My BHAG is to figure out how to model value intuitively for business owners. We''re very much focused on communicating value to our clients in ways that matter to them, using language that they prefer—rather than language we prefer. The problem is very interesting to me, and I am passionate about driving these conversations here at Facet.


#### What do you enjoy doing when you''re not working?

I have a few vices which keep me busy: coffee, mezcal, tequila, wine, cooking (learning), and I enjoy spending time in our garden tending my wild bonsai and succulents. "Epic Fantasy" novels are my jam, too.


#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

That I garden. Ha!

This is the first in what we hope will be a long list of short tutorials on different aspects of Mautic.  Today''s tutorial answers a question I received from a user last week.

There are two kinds of forms:  "Campaign" and "Standalone", each with its own characteristics.  How do I know which one to use?

### Choosing the Right Form

Campaign forms allow you to send people straight into a campaign and be the source for that campaign.  These can be edited even after a campaign has begun. Any actions you might want to perform at the time of submission, are handled by the campaign itself, and that can be limiting.

Standalone forms can also allow you to kick-off a campaign. The main difference is that the form submitter must be added to a list as one of the form actions.  The form itself cannot be used as a campaign lead.  You can perform any number of actions on a standalone form!  For instance, if you want an email sent to an administrator when the form submits, then you would use the standalone variety.

**Campaign Forms:**


	- Push the lead directly into a campaign.
	- Can not perform other actions outside of the campaign workflow.


**Standalone Forms:**


	- Can not initiate a campaign.
	- Can perform actions at submission such as:


	   - adjust a lead''s points
	   - modify lead''s lists (which must be done if this form starts a campaign)
	   - modify lead''s tags
	   - download an asset
	   - push lead to integration
	   - send email to lead
	   - send email to user
	   - send form results (such as another administrator)

**Some organizations are sales led, some marketing led and others product or finance led. What this means is that in every organization one of these groups has a little more power in influencing executive decisions than the others. Whichever way the balance of power is structured, it is important that the primary customer facing teams are aligned. Especially in how they represent the brand and deliver messages to the buyer. If this does not happen it will lead to an incongruous experience for the buyer, fewer sales and less customer satisfaction, which will ultimately impact revenue and performance for the company. According to a [study](http://blog.zoominfo.com/20-statistics-about-sales-and-marketing-alignment/) done by MarketingProfs, when alignment between marketing and sales does occur, it leads to 38% higher sales win rates.

If you are looking for your customer facing teams to be aligned, here are some tips that will guide them in the right direction.


## Tips for Marketing and Sales Alignment




- **1. Executive sponsorship is key -** Alignment starts at the top. If the leader of the sales team and the leader of the marketing team are not in lock step, this will permeate down into the organization. It is not required that these two leaders report into the same person, they just need to be focused on achieving the same objective and agree on the plan to get there.

- **2. Align terminology -** Sales and marketing must speak the same language. This helps manage expectations between marketing and sales internally as well as in customer facing conversations. One term that often causes confusion between internal teams is the word ‘lead’. Is a lead a person or an interaction? Is it a noun or a verb? Marketing advisory firms such as Sirius Decisions advise their clients to be more granular when it comes to definitions - leads can be marketing qualified leads, sales accepted leads or sales qualified leads. Having clear definitions for all terms and metrics and communicating these helps preempt misunderstandings between sales and marketing teams.

- **3. Align goals -** People manage what they are measured on. Ensuring sales and marketing teams are measured on the same end goal is one way to ensure they are working towards the same outcome. Now, I am not suggesting that marketing should have a sales quota, but just that the marketing team needs to have a ‘skin in the game’. The game being bringing in new customers and managing them through their lifecycle. One example of how this could be done is aligning compensation in a way that while the sales rep is paid on the revenue number, the marketing rep’s compensation is split between the total number of leads they bring in and the quality of lead, i.e. the leads that result in revenue.

- **4. Create a joint plan -** When a team creates a plan together they are usually more vested in ensuring its success. Create a joint team plan that documents the goals, activities and expected outcomes. If everyone cannot participate in the creation of the plan, make sure the plan is documented and communicated. The plan should not just be a calendar of marketing activities, but should also include sales spiffs, promotions and other activities that will help the team achieve their set goal.

- **5. Put SLAs (Service Level Agreements) in place -** According to a [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2011/03/the-short-life-of-online-sales-leads/ar/1), companies that try to contact potential customers within an hour of receiving queries are nearly 7 times as likely to have meaningful conversations with key decision makers as firms that try to contact prospects even an hour later.
**** Maybe an hour is not realistic for your company, but put in place realistic SLAs or service level agreements and hold the sales team responsible for what they commit to. From a marketing perspective, the commitment should be around the the number and quality of leads. Agreeing to these and delivering on these SLAs will build trust between sales and marketing and better alignment.

2. **6. Celebrate successes together -** The end goal and hence success for both sales and marketing should be the same thing. What I mean by that is, the marketing team should not be celebrating just because they have delivered the committed number of leads. Success should be when both teams’ objectives are achieved. Once that happens, don’t forget to celebrate and have some fun, because at the end of the day, teams that have fun together and are happy are likely to be more [productive](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/new_study_shows/).

4. **7. Use data and technology -** The good news is there is a plethora of systems and technologies which if implemented correctly can help you achieve better alignment by providing visibility into what activities are planned, which ones are working and a better understanding of the buyer. Keep in mind, the insights from these systems are only as good as the data you put in and track. Also, make sure the systems are tightly integrated so that relevant information from any system is available at the point of communication with the buyer as well as for a wider analysis.


Today the lines between sales and marketing are blurring. Marketing and Sales both influence the buyer’s journey throughout the lifecycle. It is more critical than ever that we align marketing and sales, and that they function as one team. At the end of the day it’s about communication, visibility and accountability. Irrespective of whether the communication is written, in person or virtual - they can all work. The more visibility each team has into what the other has planned, committed to and delivered - the better the team will be aligned and the smoother the buyer’s experience will be in dealing with the company.**', '<img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/rowing-187859-e1461078899353-1024x966.jpg" alt="alignment" width="1024" height="470" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1881" />

This problem isn’t new. For over a decade, marketers have been trying to determine how to make our content stand apart. We’ve written from different perspectives, we’ve wrapped it in creative call-to-actions and tried to engage our audience explaining why our content is more unique and valuable than the other guys. So how do we stand apart? How does our content rise above the rest?

We need to think differently. We need to start being human. Let’s imagine that all the web’s content is represented by a city.  What brings that city to life? It’s people. When we think of our hometown, we think in context of our personal relationships and experiences. We don’t think of the data (i.e. population or square miles). We think of the high school we went to and the crushes we had. We think of our first job and how tough the manager was. These stories provide the context for the city. 


## Principles to Humanize Marketing Automation


If we recognize that storytelling humanizes us and is a vital ingredient to our marketing efforts, how do we incorporate it into our marketing automation processes? 



- **Become a farmer:** Many of the expectations placed on sales and marketing teams is about quantity vs. quality. Skills are often based on the ability to convert or win. These terms immediately describe an “us vs. them” mentality. This is not how we build relationships. In a [post](http://www.copyblogger.com/think-like-a-farmer/) written by Sean Jackson, he describes the value of thinking like a farmer vs. a salesperson.  
 


> “But the farmer has a major advantage over the hunter. While the hunters must go into new territories each day to stalk their prey, farmers stay in one place, planting new seeds and reaping the fruits of their efforts on the same ground they have toiled over already. In return, the land they till becomes infinitely more valuable because it can consistently reap a harvest without the hits and misses of hunting.”


You’ve likely heard the phrase lead nurturing? It’s marketing speak for building relationships. It’s staying in one place, listening to your customers and adding value by meeting their needs at each stage of the buying journey. But we can’t accomplish this by trying to “hunt for sales”, this must be done by building trust over time, adding value at each step.  

- **The power of empathy:** Many [articles](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=empathy+in+business) have been written about the power of empathy in business. To think like a customer means that we have walked in their shoes. This goes beyond understanding the buying journey or the customer need. When we have walked in our customers shoes, we connect with them on a personal level. We are far more understanding of their needs when we understand their story. [Michael Hinshaw](http://www.cmo.com/articles/2013/9/24/understanding_the_ro.html) states this about the customer experience:  



> "Several studies back up the fact that no matter who your customers are (B2B or B2C), there’s a high price to pay for delivering a poor customer experience. The thing is, customer experience is really based on how your customers feel. And one of the best ways to make them feel better about the experience is to listen them, understand their concerns, and deliver empathetic service across multiple touchpoints.”


So delivering a positive customer experience is more than simply knowing what kind of product they use. It’s having knowledge about how and why they use it. If you sell shampoo, you need to know what kind of hair they have, why they chose the shampoo, then deliver value around the entire experience. What do they need before, during and after they shampoo their hair? This information helps create customer empathy. When we deliver this kind of content via our automation processes, it will show that we have listened and seek to provide real value along the way.

- **Getting personal:** In his latest book [X: The Experience When Business Meets Design](http://amzn.com/B00JZOZDUO), Brian Solis outlines the importance of the customer experience. It’s going beyond the data. It’s about getting personal.  



> “Big data provides great information about customers’ interests, personal and professional networks, location, and many other characteristics. But creating meaningful experiences requires us to get more personal than just mining data. One of my least favorite expressions is, “It’s not personal; it’s only business.”


This is where the rubber meets the road. Data gives us a limited view of our customers. It shows us open rates, but doesn’t reveal intent. It shows us downloads, but doesn’t indicate purpose. We must take the additional step to “micro-mine” the data. How do we do that? We must be curious. We must gather valuable insights. What are your customers interests, values and opinions? “Data storytellers” (or analysts) have the unique ability to reveal information that do reveal incredibly accurate stories about our audience. Gathering and listening to these stories will help us further humanize our content and create experiences that are meaningful and personal.

## The Tactics of Humanization


In order to humanize our marketing automation efforts we must critically look at each interaction during the customer experience as it relates to our communications and determine how we humanize it. Here are a few thoughts to get you started.



- **Be Relational:** This goes without saying. Create an experience where your customer sees you as a real live person, not a large organization or automated system. Use the proper tags (first name, etc.) from your automation system to relate to your audience. If your customers all have a specific kind of goldfish, then tell them that you are running a special for that kind of goldfish. Speak in an authentic personal tone. Business speak will get you a one way ticket to Irrelevant-ville.

- **Segmentation:** Another way to humanize our marketing automation is to use one of the most powerful tools in our automation toolbox, segmentation. When we cast a broad net with our marketing and communication, it robs us of our ability to be relevant. Take the time to segment your audience into very specific groups. This will allow you to create communications that are personal and relevant. When we can provide very targeted messages that relate to our customers on a personal level, it will feel human. 

- **Logical Campaign Flow:** This can be tricky. Now that we have this shiny new automation system, it’s tempting to automate our every interaction. But proceed with caution. Remember what it feels like to be the customer. If they don’t answer your email, then sending them another one the next day, is not good relationship building practice. Step back and consider the buying journey. At what steps are decisions being made? When does it make sense to re-engage your audience? Take time to ask some of your existing customers about their journey.

- **Consider the Entire Customer Experience:** The best way to add value and relate to your customer is to acknowledge them not only before and during the sale, but after it as well. Too often our marketing efforts stop at the cash register. Don’t allow the dollar signs to get in the way of delivering exceptionally personal experience by following up. Are there other areas of the customer experience you can add value to? How did their experience with your product or service go? Were they satisfied?

  

This is not an easy task. It takes an immense amount of time to walk in the shoes of your customer. From the moment they discover the need, all the way through the moment their need is met, and beyond. But just as any relationship takes time to develop, so does automating your marketing. Marketing Automation is still relatively new. While the systems are vast, there is a simple philosophy that your team should adhere to before generating the campaigns, emails and landing pages that will capture your audience''s attention. It’s the philosophy of making every interaction human.', 'I love a good story. It creates context for our relationships.

Marketing and IT often have different objectives. Typically the Marketing group cares about getting more leads, more customers and growing revenue.  The IT group is measured on whether they''ve implemented the right technologies, kept costs down and served the business. To be successful, there must be a high level commitment to the vision of what project will accomplish. This includes transcending the metrics the teams are measured on. In order to do this properly, roles and areas of responsibility for all members of the project team must be clearly defined.


## Defining Relationship Roles and Responsibilities


The [RACI model](https://www.projectsmart.co.uk/how-to-do-raci-charting-and-analysis.php) helps organizations define roles & responsibilities during a change process. The ‘A” stands for who is ultimately accountable for the success of the task, at a high level. The Marketing department should be responsible for defining the problem. They should also determine the vision for the business process. The IT department should be responsible for providing guidance on technologies. Implementation and ongoing support is IT''s responsibility. It is not enough to just define high level ownership, as the devil is always in the details - accountability for each step must be clearly defined.

What are the steps to implementing a new technology and who does what?



2. **Defining the problem** - This is typically the first step. Marketing needs to clearly define and communicate what the current challenge or opportunity is that they are trying to solve.

4. **Defining desired outcomes** - Next, Marketing must create a proposal to explain the problem or opportunity and get internal teams to buy in to try and solve it. For large enough projects it is important to have sponsors, preferably the CMO and the CIO to ensure alignment from the top down.

6. **Defining the requirements** - This stage of the project is an interesting one as either Marketing or IT could be accountable for this step. Keep in mind, whoever is writing the detailed requirements should have an understanding of the Marketing goals and a good idea of what can be achieved with technology.

8. **Offering up technologies** - The first decision that needs to be made is whether to build or buy. If the decision is to buy, or at least start by looking at what technologies are out there, this is usually a joint effort between the Marketing and IT teams. Though IT is ultimately accountable, it is critical to get buy in from the Marketing business folks as they will the the users of this technology.

10. **Choosing a vendor** - The next step is to choose a vendor and this is one where truly IT and Marketing have equal footing. Sometimes the owner of the budget has a little more say in the end decision, but at the end of the day the chosen solution must solve the business need and also meet IT standards.

12. **Building and integrating the solution** - This is where the handoff to IT begins. Depending on the decision that has been made, they build the solution or buy one and integrate it into the existing technology stack.

14. **Project management** - For any large project to be successful, you need a strong project manager. Since IT leads the implementation process, it makes sense for the IT team to be ultimately responsible for ensuring timeliness and quality.

16. **Testing** - Initial testing is usually owned by the IT team. Once they have determined the system is stable, they will hand over testing to the Marketing team. The Marketing team then validates that the requested functionality meets their need as defined in the requirements.

18. **Launch** - Once the new technology is ready, it should be treated like a product launch. The Marketing team needs to position the benefits of this new technology, train users and ensure adoption. Celebrating successes together is also important once the project has launched.

20. **Ongoing maintenance** - At the end of the day, the IT team is the team that supports all technical issues for the Marketing team. It is important for IT to have a good handle on what has been built, have resources to support it and also a relationship with the vendor to escalate issues if necessary.




## Eliminating Breakups


Relationships are never easy, they take an immense amount of effort to maintain. To that end, if the relationship with your ‘work spouse’ is on rocky terrain, here is some wise counsel to encourage you to get back on the right track.



- The first, of course, is to follow a similar process to the one above. Lack of clarity around roles, areas of ownership and goals can cause a rift between Marketing and IT.

- Don''t go it alone. When the Marketing and IT leadership is not aligned, it sometimes results in either group managing to secure the budget and purchasing a rogue tool that may or may not meet Marketing''s needs or IT''s requirements. This serves no one well, ultimately making it a business management nightmare. 

- Make critical decisions with the end in mind. When technology decisions are made for the sake of implementing shiny new technologies v.s. to enable a business need. If the technology does not solve a business problem, chances are adoption will be low and cause turmoil between the two teams.



Like a marriage, the relationship between IT and Marketing must be one of accountability, compromise and teamwork. Aligning these teams will ensure successful implementation of the technologies that solve business problems. And as you all work toward the success of your company, don’t forget to enjoy the ride!', 'As the owner of many marketing technology implementations, projects that are the most successful have strong IT partners.

#### Transcript:


As many of you know I’ve grown up in the open source and CMS world. I have had the distinct privilege of working & volunteering in multiple open source communities and have been able to witness firsthand the power of community. I’ve also had the opportunity to see the struggle between community & company. I’ve seen the benefits and detriments to all different types of organizational structures and have lately been spending considerable time holding meetings, asking questions and listening to answers as it relates to the Mautic community and organizational structure. Now **I am eager to share the results of those discussions and the path for our future. **

One of the things which prompted these various meetings and discussions was a common question, maybe even some concern which I began to hear repeated within the community and from customers of the Mautic.com service. **There was a growing sense of frustration and confusion surrounding the support for Mautic.com users.** Those users who were subscribed to the Allyde service provided at Mautic.com were unsure where to find answers to their questions or gain support. Was the Mautic community forums only for self-hosted Mautic users? Was Slack available for everyone? I admit it was terribly annoying and distinctly frustrating for everyone.

But it wasn’t just the Allyde users who were confused and frustrated. The community grew frustrated because of features available on Mautic.com (and provided by Allyde) that were not available in the core Mautic installation. Of course Allyde was merely doing what any company might do (creating a plugin integration to extend Mautic with additional features). **But still the frustrations existed and it bothered me (and others). **

This frustration was felt by everyone and it was not the feeling we wanted anyone in our community or as Allyde customers to experience. Then there was the additional problems related to potential hinderances to growth, the speed of our innovation, and the power of an open cloud solution. 

And so I began talking with people. **I reached out to open source experts, trusted advisors, and our own Mautic community leaders.** I discussed possible solutions and ways to improve the situation. And as I mentioned before - I’m extremely excited to share the results of those meetings. 

**Over the next week Allyde and Mautic will join to be a single Mautic brand.** This means Mautic.com will be run by Mautic and will now be providing cloud-based Mautic installations directly to the community and to others. This means a simplified user experience for everyone. And not just support - an improved Mautic product will be made available as a result as well. Those features previously only available on Mautic.com will be slowly integrated into the core Mautic product and made available to everyone. 

I know there are questions as a result of this process and I certainly want to make sure I answer them all to the best of my ability. Let me attempt to do that now. If you have questions feel free to send them in and I’ll do my best to answer quickly.  


#### Q&A:


**Why is the merger occurring?** 
There are a few main value drivers behind this merger. They are:

- **Growth:** With a market penetration of just over 12%, there is an immense opportunity to leverage the growth engine of the Mautic.com SaaS solution and open source philosophy to increase awareness and growth.
- **Innovation:** Innovation is happening in the open source community and is being realized by SaaS adoption. By fostering innovation at the community level and leveraging the growth of SaaS, we can continue to innovate Mautic as a growth platform.
- **Consistency:** There is currently a disconnect between the service that Allyde provides at Mautic.com and the open source community/solution that is Mautic.org. Because these solutions are not any different, combining these groups will eliminate confusion and allow us to provide the best possible customer experience from a single point.


**What will the corporate structure look like? Who will run what?**
We recognize that with any organization requires structure. Mautic’s structure will be based entirely on its goal of creating the best marketing automation software and making it available to everyone. To that end, I will continue to lead the effort in working with the community of developers/users to add innovative new features and grow the open source solution. Additional team members have been brought on to address specific client use cases, such as enterprises and agencies. These services will be combined with Allyde’s existing cloud service and sold as value-added services offered on Mautic.com. 

**Will Mautic continue to be open source?**
Yes. This will never change. Mautic will always be free. Even as we seek to provide additional value to more businesses with a variety of add-on services, our core belief in the philosophy of open source will not change.

**Will the developer community continue to play a role in the direction of the solution?**
The developer community is vital to Mautic. Without the community, it is nothing. For that reason, the open source community will absolutely play an integral role in it’s growth.

**Is this just a way to make money?**
We believe in the foundation of our community. It is the community that has propelled our growth. This merger is not about money. It is about further strengthening the Mautic brand and allowing us the opportunity to provide even more value to a wider segment of people. The core of Mautic will always be the philosophy of empowering organizations to reach their audience with an open source solution. This merger helps to accomplish this by providing our community and users with even more opportunity to connect and share value via Mautic.

**What will happen to Allyde’s partner program?**
Our partner program began with a single focus, to provide businesses with an opportunity to extend their brand with “new-to-the-market” services equipped to increase their audience. We still believe these services are valuable and that more organizations are looking for opportunities to do just that. We also recognize that a simplification in branding will help to raise awareness of our partners. Automation services are in great demand and so too are organizations that can guide them to successful implementation. We will continue to offer the Partnership Program and will work to provide an exciting option for organizations. The partner program will only change in name and ultimately become even more of a powerful value-add for our partners.

If you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to visit the [forum](https://www.mautic.org/community/), [Slack](https://www.mautic.org/slack) or contact us via [email](mailto:info@mautic.org). Our goal is to be as open as possible and provide as much information as we can.

At Mautic, we want to help you **build meaningful relationships**.  This can be with potential customers, constituents or even business partners.

We do this by providing you with the tools to reach them. These include among other things **forms, landing pages, assets, emails, text messages and web notifications**.  Once all these are ready, you can incorporate them into simple or complex **campaigns**.

As people flow through campaigns, you can segment them into more refined groups, create follow up points of contact and more!

Finally, the best campaigns are properly **evaluated** campaigns!  Mautic gives you a drag and drop dashboard and reports to help you track everything.

### We call this the "PACE" workflow.

If you''re using the** self-hosted** version of Mautic, you need to check your CRON jobs.

### Cron jobs are one of the most frequent topics in our Slack chats.

Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like computer operating systems. Cron schedules jobs (commands or shell scripts) to run at fixed times, dates, or intervals.  **Mautic requires cron jobs to update contacts, campaigns and execute campaign actions.**  Mautic also optionally uses cron jobs to send emails and perform other related tasks.

If you''re in the marketing department, that may sound like "greek" to you.  In this Mautic Minute, we explain cron jobs and visually explain each part.

### Mautic requires three cron jobs:



	- Keeping segments current - php /path/to/mautic/app/console mautic:segments:update
	- Keeping campaigns updated -  php /path/to/mautic/app/console mautic:campaigns:update
	- Trigger campaign events - php /path/to/mautic/app/console mautic:campaigns:trigger


![cron jobs in CPanel](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/cron-jobs-cpanel-1024x574.jpg)


These paths will change based on your web server and Mautic installation.


	- if you''re not sure, ask your web host for the path to php .
	- if you''re comfortable with the shell and have access, run this command: which php.
	- to find the root of your website run: pwd - then add the Mautic directories after the response (see the image below).


There are several optional cron jobs, depending on your configuration.  You can read the full documentation at  [https://mautic.org/docs/en/setup/cron_jobs.html](https://mautic.org/docs/en/setup/cron_jobs.html). There are a few host-specific notes in the full documentation and it is worthwhile to completely read through.

](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/form-actions1.jpg)Using standalone forms, you can do the following at the time of submission:



	- Adjust a contact''s points
	- Modify a contact''s segment
	- Modify a contact''s tags
	- Provide an asset to download
	- Push the contact to an integration (like a CRM)
	- Send an email to the contact
	- Send an email to any user
	- Send the form results to anyone


**It is important to note that if you use this type of form, you must send the contact to a segment to include them in a campaign later on.**

Adding actions to a form is really helpful.  In this Mautic Minute video, we demonstrate five actions, all triggered by a single form submission.  You could create a form that uses all the actions or just one.  It''s that powerful.

One of the most powerful ways to engage people is through a story. A couple of weeks ago members of the Mautic team spent time discovering the story we’re all writing. What we determined is that it’s a story of open. Providing immense capability in the form of an open connection to community. Empowering individuals, businesses and enterprises alike with open access to powerful communication tools. We''ve heard so many of you share your excitement of finding a solution that enables you to share the powerful story of your organization with a receptive audience. To more deeply understand the needs of your customers and bring them value. 

We''re thrilled to continue writing this story of open with you. Equipping you with more tools to share your stories in a meaningful and compelling way. The features in Mautic 2.0 will change the way you market. They will begin to help you connect systems in your business, ultimately creating memorable customer experiences at each and every lifecycle stage.

We can’t wait to see how you use these features! We’d encourage you to visit the [Community Forum](https://www.mautic.org/community), [Slack](https://www.mautic.org/slack), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/trymautic), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mautic) and other channels to share all the incredible things you’re doing with Mautic. Have you developed a unique campaign? Are you providing incredible value and seeing the results? Share it with the community!

**


### **Javascript Chart Update**

Reports in Mautic have always been fully customizable. But what do you do when you want to compare elements of a single campaign over time? This state of the art dashboard feature will enable intuitive analysis of campaign performance by highlighting/selecting specific metrics to load into dashboard.  






**


### **New Email and Landing Page Builder**

Our WSYIWIG editor has been getting accolades since the moment we launched Mautic. But when we set our sights on better usability, good things happen. We invite you to check out the brand new email and landing page editor. Now there is more creative and developer control than ever before. We can’t wait to see what you develop while using these tools. For a closer look at theme development, [click here](https://www.mautic.org/blog/developer/theme-development-in-mautic-2-0/).  






**


### **Code Re-Factoring Part 1**

Not only are features important to 2.0, but so is performance. We believe that time is an incredibly valuable resource. So we have focused our efforts on making Mautic faster and more reliable. Use your time more effectively, engaging your customers. Part 1 is complete, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg.  






**


### **UTM Tags**

One of the most powerful aspects of marketing automation is segmentation. When you can specify certain types of communication to go to very specific segments, engagement happens. Now with UTM (Urchin Tracking Module), you can gain greater insight by tracking, monitoring and segmenting your traffic and contacts.  






**


### **The Lifecycle Dashboard**

Segmentation is clearly an extremely powerful tool. However, it does not do a good job tracking the progression of contacts through the buying journey. We’d like to introduce the Lifecycle Dashboard. Track and trigger updates based on lifecycle stages for contacts. Use a new dashboard to analyze what stages contacts in various segments are at.  






**


### **Campaign Attribution Reports**

Return on Investment. As a marketer this acronym is often the cornerstone of your marketing efforts. With a whole new set of reports, you can now measure campaign success based on first touch, last touch or multi touch attribution. With this level of reporting, you business can track each individual interaction across the entire customer lifecycle attributing revenue goals to your marketing campaigns.  






**


### **Bi-Directional Salesforce Integration**

You’ve spoken, and we’re listening. Introducing the bi-directional sync between Salesforce and Mautic. You can now trigger more relevant communications based on data tracked in Salesforce. This is the first of many steps toward developing a more robust and open marketing stack for your business.  





And that one more thing we referenced?


**


### **Dynamic Content**

That''s right. One of the most requested features we’ve received to date is here. You can now send dynamic content as part of your campaign activity. Not only that, but you can also measure it’s effectiveness. Providing dynamic content is one of the most powerful ways you can engage your audience and provide a customized user experience.  





To help you better understand these incredible new features, we''ve assembled a short playlist of videos. Each video will give you a step-by-step overview, designed to walk through each feature''s functionality. We hope you''ll take the time to watch and share them. Be sure to hover over the playlist button and scroll down to access them all.

When the theme is opened in the builder, the div with `attribute data-slot="text"` will make the text inside the div editable within the inline [Froala editor](https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor).

The 2 slot types currently built:


	- **Image: **Inserts a single image into the div. User can click on it and edit it with options which provides Froala editor (link, change image source, alt text, …)
	- **Button:** Insert a HTML button. User can define URL as well as padding, size and position.



### Slot containers

As stated before, users can drag & drop the new slots into the theme. So as a theme developer, you have to define where the user can drop the slots. You can do it again with a single HTML attribute `data-slot-container`. Example:


> <div data-slot-container="">
<div data-slot="text"><a>@JaneDoe</a> has invited you to join Awesome inc!</div>
</div>


This way the builder will let users drop the new slots into this container. In the example above there is already one predefined slot which user can move to another container, remove or edit.

This functionality will provide you with lots of creative freedom for designing and developing your own unique email and landing pages. Have a unique design? Share it with the community! We would love to see how you''re using Mautic to engage your audience.', 'As some of the new features found in Mautic 2.0 make their way into your workflow, we wanted to take a couple of minutes to further outline some of the capability in the email/landing page builder. 

Currently the new builder doesn’t work with the content slots defined in PHP, but instead directly in the HTML template. This allows the slots to be moved around the theme layout, giving the user that ability to add/remove them as needed.

<blockquote>&lt;div data-slot="text"&gt;
&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href=""&gt;@JaneDoe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; has invited you to join Awesome inc!
&lt;/div&gt;</blockquote>

<h3>Slot definition</h3>
The slot can be defined by a single HTML attribute <code>data-slot="{slot type here}"</code>. For example, the text slot can be defined even with the demo content.

When the theme is opened in the builder, the div with <code>attribute data-slot="text"</code> will make the text inside the div editable within the inline <a href="https://www.froala.com/wysiwyg-editor">Froala editor</a>.

The 2 slot types currently built:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Image: </strong>Inserts a single image into the div. User can click on it and edit it with options which provides Froala editor (link, change image source, alt text, …)</li>

<h3>Slot containers</h3>

There is "quite literally no situation in which the importance of a dozen different voices is a positive thing", or so you''ve been led to believe. But it is not always true the old saying about the more cooks you have in the kitchen the worse the soup.

In fact there are some situations where the more people you have the better the product. And this is where we find ourselves today with the world of open source, or crowd-sourced platforms. It seems we are living in an age were everything is crowd-sourced. A place where the voice of the larger community dictates the future of the product. And for the most part we appreciate and we enjoy this increased insight and ability to influence the future of a product, platform, or service.

But I think there''s one place where we have not yet fully understood or grasped the true power of crowdsourcing. And this concept of crowdsourced creativity should not be timidly avoided. We need to examine how to unlock the true power of crowdsourcing and community when it comes to our creativity.

## What Creativity Is Not.

Before we get into crowdsourced creativity it would behoove us to look at what creativity is not. Here are three short thoughts about what creativity is not. First, **creativity is not one, single idea**. In fact creativity is the combination of many ideas. It''s the culmination of discussions, of debate, of animated talk, idle conversations and moments of deep thought. The idea that creativity is a flash of brilliance, or a stroke of genius, is a gross misunderstanding of creativity.

Secondly, **creativity is not leaderless.** Creativity does not involve a lack of leadership, guidance, and direction. Guided creative sessions are always the best way. Blind, aimless wanderings will struggle to yield the same benefits. The notion that creativity is “free” and “unmanaged” is another way of looking at this. This notion is a myth. Creativity requires leadership.

Lastly, **creativity is not static**. Creativity is a dynamic process. Creativity does not get stuck any single form, encapsulated in a single idea, or stagnate, never to be improved upon. The best examples of creativity involve an evolving continually improving way of thinking. Creativity doesn’t sit still.

## What Creativity Is.

Next we look at what creativity is. Creativity is the aggregate of information collected and combined from a variety of resources, ideas, thoughts, dreams, and aspirations. Creativity is encouraged by visionary leaders who want to see something changed, something improved, the world moved. Creativity, as everything else in life, changes. Creativity should grow and improve over time.

## 4 Key Requirements

Knowing this, we ask the question: what are the requirements to see creativity be successful in a crowdsourced community environment? I believe there are four key requirements for crowdsourced creativity to be truly successful.

### Trust

The first requirement for successful creativity in a community is trust. Without trust your volunteers and community members will feel timid, shy, and unwilling to share their ideas, thoughts, and feelings for fear of being rejected, ridiculed, or mocked. Trust must be established. There must be a sense of safety in a community, a safe environment where each individual has the ability to be oneself.

### Respect

The second requirement for success is respect. This follows along quite nicely with the first because when you respect someone you give them a sense of trust. And you feel trusted. Mutual respect encourages that trust. Respect plays a role in crowd source creativity. This isn''t always easy but it is always required. Maturity and the ability to rise above differences to listen to those differences without reacting aggressively is a difficult but necessary skill to learn. When you have the ability to respect someone else''s views and opinions that differ from your own and not harshly judge them this respect them you build the relationship, a relationship built on trust.

> "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."
*- F. Scott Fitzgerald*


### Communication

The third requirement for success is communication. I would go so far as to say **open communication**. Because what good are your thoughts and ideas and feelings if they''re not shared? You must be able to share those. You must be able to communicate what you''re thinking and feeling. The creativity as it strikes you must be communicated to others in the community. I reflect back to the idea of building culture. Remember, that building culture does not begin, your “things” don’t affect culture until they are shared with others. The cultural goods you create are nothing if they aren''t shared. You may as well be creating them in a vacuum or void.

### Goal Setting

The final requirement we focus on for community creativity to be successful relate to goals. Meaningful, relevant goals. This is how you drive your creativity towards a solution. And yes, even something as ephemeral as creativity, should have goals. Now your goals don''t necessarily need to be increasing revenues by 5%, or generating a higher ROI on a landing page. Goals can be much simpler and less tangible while still being relevant and meaningful.

## Community Appplication

If those are the requirements for crowdsourced creativity to be successful then here are the ways we can put those into practice within the community.

### Reiteration

Reiteration, or the continued expression of those ideas or goals what you previously have defined and shared within the community is a very practical way to encourage crowdsourced creativity. When you reiterate an idea for a creative piece of work you will inevitably refine that idea. You''ll find a better way to structure a sentence, or turn a phrase, or share the passion behind what you are thinking. Re-iteration is fundamental to a good crowd sourced creative environment.

### Recognition

When working in a community an incredibly critical part of community growth is the *continued recognition, awareness, and intentional engagement of newcomers.* Your community is only as successful as individuals who make it up. Your community growth is only as successful as the newcomers to your community. If you want your community to be successful you need to make sure the individuals are successful. And newcomers are a critical part of this entire experience. Recognizing that the newcomers don''t fully understand the ideas and creative processes which occurred before their arrival will lead you to implementing a better open dialogue. Reiteration of goals is helpful also in the establishment of respect and trust.

### Culture

Lastly, as I touched on briefly before, **crowdsourced creativity is cultural**. You will have differences of opinions. You will have different ideas. You will have differing views on the best approach to solving problem, to share an idea, or to instill passion. The best way to ensure that your crowdsourced creative outlets are aligned, is to ensure there is a shared central belief. And that is the definition of culture. As a result, crowdsourced creativity is at its most extreme, most raw, most fundamental layer: cultural. So establish your culture well. *Create your culture well.*

------

Invite newcomers to your community with open arms and treat them with respect. Build trust as you communicate with them the ideas you''ve had in the past. Share the creative sparks of inspiration which have made your community successful and encourage them to become involved. **Encourage them to share their own sparks of brilliance.** Remember, creativity is not stagnant. The surest way for your community to die as for your creativity to die. And so ultimately you should encourage crowd-sourced creativity; your future depends on it.', 'If I''ve heard it once I''ve heard it at least a thousand times: Design by committee is... a nightmare. There is "quite literally no situation in which the importance of a dozen different voices is a positive thing", or so you''ve been led to believe.

Mautic is an incredible international community. And each member has unique value. There are meetup organizers, developers, users and translators from all over the globe. Every single person has made an incredible contribution to bring Mautic to where it is today. We wanted to continue to celebrate that contribution by hosting our very own Mautic Summer Games! 

As training for the Rio Olympics  gets underway, we see the immense work that is done by these athletes in preparation for the games. In a similar manner, each of us works hard to compete in today’s business world. We plan, organize, implement and deploy new ideas. Although our environment may not be an open stadium, it is certainly an open marketplace. And unlike the real Olympics where only a single person is rewarded with a medal, everyone wins when you contribute to an open source project like Mautic.  


## Who can participate?
 
According to Olympic records, Cecilia Colledge was the youngest female competitor in the Olympics. She was only 11YO.  The oldest to ever compete? Arthur von Pongracz of Austria, who was 72. We''d like to approach the Mautic Summer Games in a same manner. We believe everyone has worth and value. That you can contribute and participate to this community in some way shape or form. So we''re excited to open up the competition to developers/creators/designers of all ages.  


## What are the events?
 
In preparation for the Mautic Summer Games we wanted to give you a rundown of all the different events that we will be offering. Regardless of your skill level or expertise, everyone should be able to participate.

Although our environment may not be an open stadium, it is certainly an open marketplace. And unlike the real Olympics where only a single person is rewarded with a medal, everyone wins when you contribute to an open source project like Mautic.  

<h2>Who can participate?</h2> 
According to Olympic records, Cecilia Colledge was the youngest female competitor in the Olympics. She was only 11YO.  The oldest to ever compete? Arthur von Pongracz of Austria, who was 72. We''d like to approach the Mautic Summer Games in a same manner. We believe everyone has worth and value. That you can contribute and participate to this community in some way shape or form. So we''re excited to open up the competition to developers/creators/designers of all ages.  

<h2>What are the events?</h2> 
In preparation for the Mautic Summer Games we wanted to give you a rundown of all the different events that we will be offering. Regardless of your skill level or expertise, everyone should be able to participate.

Hi! I’m Marissa. I am this summer’s marketing intern! I feel so incredibly lucky to be a part of such a fun and young company for the summer and I am so excited to be in Boston with the Mautic team! 

![MeetTheIntern2016](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/MeetTheIntern2016-1024x542.jpg)


As an intern, I know I am going to learn a lot this summer, and I am excited for the opportunity to share this newfound knowledge through a series of summer blog posts. In this new summer intern series I hope to offer some insight into my role and share my experiences working for a startup. I want to use this blog as a platform to share and document my adventures and to showcase all the exciting things going on at Mautic. So…let’s get started!


### How I Got Here

As a rising senior in college I knew that it was crucial to secure a summer internship. Having an internship would help me learn more about myself and what fields I was interested in. Internships are a great opportunity to expand your skill set and learn about new industries and job opportunities and I wanted to take advantage. 

To be honest, when I first applied for the position, I did not know what marketing automation was, or that there was a whole industry dedicated to marketing technology (shocking I know). As a marketing major this was pretty eye opening. There was a whole industry in my field of study that I had no idea existed, and as it turns out, is pretty cool! As I did more research on the field, the more interested I became in the position. I was curious about how you could automate the process of delivering content while still maintaining a personal tone. It definitely got me thinking about how companies I love deliver their content to me, and I just need to know more.   

Although I was unfamiliar with the field, it did not deter me from applying, in fact it made me want to apply more. I loved the idea of learning about a completely unfamiliar field and being part of a startup.  I also knew this was a great opportunity to expand my learning beyond the classroom. Marketing Automation is growing and innovating at an unprecedented rate and I thought it was important to learn more about the industry. I consider it a luxury to be a part of such a young company and have access to experienced professionals in the field. It’s been such a huge help while trying to learn the basics of marketing automation and Mautic itself. 


### What I Expected and What Actually Happened

That being said, I have to admit after I was offered the position I was a little worried about how my lack of technical knowledge would impact my work. I mentioned in my interview that I was not very familiar with marketing automation or with marketing technology in general, but I still feared that this could prove to be a major setback. I did not want my lack of knowledge to prevent me from doing a good job and I honestly couldn’t see myself picking up the tech lingo quickly. 

I’m so happy I was wrong.

I definitely do not consider myself an expert at this point, but I am happy at the progress I’ve made. The language can still be difficult at times, but it is not as much of an obstacle as I thought. Having a small team of experienced individuals and Google at my disposal definitely doesn’t hurt! It’s also been fun learning how to use Mautic. I honestly thought I would be plagued by technical incompetency and be weakly attempting to market a product I couldn’t understand. 

But that didn’t happen!

Mautic actually is an easy to use tool! When I first signed up and started using it was obvious that it was a sophisticated software and jam packed with advanced and diverse features, but it is user friendly and easy to figure out with a little time and research. I am a visual learner so I spent my first week as an intern doing research and learning how to use the tool with help from video clips on our YouTube page. I loved that there were an abundance of resources at my disposal to help make my experience with Mautic even better. 


### What I’ll Do

My objective this summer is to help show the world how great Mautic is. As the marketing intern, my tasks will center mostly around raising awareness and developing leads. But, if there’s one thing I have learned working at a startup is that roles are not rigid, and there is a lot of room for flexibility. This is exciting for me because I get the opportunity to try out different roles and projects. In my first two weeks I have worked on a diverse number of assignments designed to help different areas of the business. 

As a millennial, social media happens to be a natural skill of mine. I want to use this inherent skill to help build more awareness for the Mautic brand. Primarily through social media campaigns and reform, I hope to bring our current community closer together and bring others aboard. My hope is to make our current social media more social and to introduce some new platforms into the mix by the end of my summer here. Social media is such a great tool to allow others an inside look into the company. I love getting a behind the scenes look at companies I admire, and I hope to bring that same element to Mautic’s social media campaigns. 


### What I’ll Leave With

I know that I am going to be learning a lot about a lot this summer and I could not be more excited to  bring that knowledge back to my college campus. You gain experience at any internship, but coming into this position I knew I would be getting something unique. Working at a startup has given me the opportunity to try my hand at a number of activities and I’m not limited to just one task or one project for the whole summer. I’m learning how to write blog posts and use Wordpress, LinkedIn is actually useful to me now, and networking is still hard but it’s not as scary. I never could have anticipated such personal growth and development in such a short period of time, but I’m more than happy it’s happened. 

This summer is my time to grow as young professional. Being involved with a diversity of projects here at Mautic gives me the opportunity to build on my professional skill set and further separate my likes and dislikes in the workplace. I look forward to taking the foundation I’ll build here at Mautic and going back to school to further my professional development. 

It’s going to be a jam packed summer and I cannot wait to share it with all of you!', '<img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/speech-bubbles-1379252_1920-1024x705.jpg" alt="speech-bubbles-1379252_1920" width="720" height="496" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2258" />

If you’d like to suggest a topic, please head over to the #[support](https://mautic.slack.com/archives/support) channel and message @imrodmartin.', 'The Campaign Builder is the hub to Mautic''s many spokes. It''s the glue for every interaction with a contact. It''s one of Mautic''s real strengths. But as the platform developed, quite a number of options began appearing in the right menu and creating a campaign involved a lot of scrolling to find the item you wanted. Mautic 2.1 changes all that with a new way of adding actions, decisions and conditions.

We all value growth. It is a necessary ingredient in life and business. Whether we like it or not, growth often comes with its own set of unique challenges. The real opportunity with growth is to harness it''s full power and capability to propel your business forward. Like an engine. A Deloitte [report](http://deloitteblog.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Building-a-Growth-Engine-Four-steps-to-close-the-quantum-growth-gap.pdf) defined a growth engine as:


> ...a systematic and repeatable organizational capability to achieve and maintain profitable and significant growth.


With each bug we squash and new feature we develop, we seek to tackle each challenge your business may face. Ultimately building Mautic into an "organizational capability" that will help you fast track your growth. 

Your journey is our journey. We are poised and ready to support your growth as you create meaningful experiences with your customers. Release 2.1 carries with it a number of features that we believe will help your business, and ultimately your customers, grow faster and smarter. This release includes the following;


### Campaign Management



- **Custom Themes:** Users now have the ability to upload and use their own custom themes! Create an email or landing page theme/template that represents your brand and use it over and over again. Administrators can upload, download, view or delete themes by accessing the theme menu item in the settings area. All users on the account can access the custom themes from the theme selection area while building new emails and landing pages.
- **Multi Lingual Dynamic Content on Emails and Landing Pages:** Many businesses work with customers around the globe. Now a preferred language can automatically be associated with a contact based on the language settings in their browser! Users can translate a page or email into various languages and also link different versions together. The page or email is then dynamically displayed into the contacts language! (if a translation exists). The default language can also be set manually.
- **New Campaign Builder Experience:** Building campaigns should be incredibly fast and intuitive. Well the campaign builder has has gotten a powerful usability increase! A list of available actions are displayed by clicking on the ‘+’ for each campaign item making it more efficient to use the campaign builder. Talk about a time saver.




### Contact Management



- **Progressive Profiling:** Forms now have dynamic fields! When serving up a form, information that the system already knows about the contact can be hidden, and alternate fields can be displayed in their place. This ensures that the contact is only asked to complete limited information every time they fill out a form. This reduces the risk of abandoning a form when they are part way through. Yes!
- **Touch Management:** There are specific times when you should send information through specific channels. Administrators can now set limits on the maximum number of times a contact can receive a message through a particular channel. Limits can be set per channel, system wide for all contacts and can also be overwritten at the individual contact level. Don’t fall into the trap of over communicating with your contacts.
- **New Interface for Timeline Activities:** Viewing timeline activities in the contact record can be a struggle. Well, now you can view record detail in a tab-based format, making it much easier to consume and filter activities. Here’s to making information easier to read!




### Reporting and Tracking



- **Reporting on SMS and Web:** You want more detail, we’ve got more detail. Information such as creator, date and category are now tracked for the SMS and Web notification channels. This enables better understanding and visibility of the content sent through these channels.
- **Device Granularity: **Now you can see which devices contacts are using to view their emails and landing pages! Two new dashboard widgets have been created to show device usage by segment and by channel. Now you can view a breakdown of usage based on devices such as a tablet, mobile or desktop. Device information is also available for each email/landing page, on the contact timeline and in reports. This feature will help you understand what devices your contacts are using to consume your content.




### Integrations



- **Expanded Salesforce Integration:** The integration to Salesforce has been expanded! Now, information from contacts in Salesforce can be mapped back to contacts in Mautic! Timeline activity from the contact in Mautic can be also be written back to the Lead or Contact record in Salesforce. This enables sales users in Salesforce to see what marketing activities the record has interacted with. Win. Win.
- **Video Integration:** Deeper video integration is here! Users can insert videos from Vimeo or YouTube or any other mp4 platforms onto landing pages with a gate. This means the user can require a contact to fill out a form after the video has played for a predefined period of time. Video consumption metrics including time viewed and percent of the video watched are also available on the contact’s timeline.

There were so many activities and events I had the opportunity to participate in and I could not be more satisfied with how I spent my time. As I get ready to go back to school, I thought it would be great to reflect on some of my best moments this summer. 

![summer](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/myMauticSummerImage-1024x470.jpg)


For starters, I turned 21. Not gonna say much on this, but it’s been pretty great. I tried tiramisu for the first time at a restaurant on the North End (10/10 would absolutely eat again). For the second time, I saw The Zac Brown Band at Fenway. And for the second time, they performed my favorite song of all time, Colder Weather. I cried. I also went to Patriots Training Camp, tried calamari, and won trivia night at my local 99 restaurant. An all around A+ summer for sure. 

But despite all these cool and awesome things I did, the best part of my summer was working for Mautic. Seriously. Internships have the unfortunate label of being a necessary evil, but mine was as far from evil as you can get. I got to work with awesome people at an awesome company and work on awesome projects. My time at Mautic this summer was (you guessed it) AWESOME. 



### What I Did


I knew that I wanted an internship that would give me the opportunity to try my hand at a variety of different projects. I’m still young! I thought it was important to be exposed to different disciplines within a business to find out what I liked, what I didn’t, and what I was good at. My favorite part of this internship was the opportunity to work on variety of projects. In the beginning, I did a lot of research and testing to get familiar with marketing automation and with Mautic itself. After setting a good base, I was able to really dig in and start working on projects that had a direct impact on our company. 

In three months I wrote a blog post (though I wanted to write more), drafted emails, edited leads, launched an Instagram profile, organized a booth at Boston Tech Jam, made a content calendar, tracked social media metrics, and helped organize our first Boston meetup. I was almost always busy with a new project and I would not have changed it at all. 


### What I Wish Went Better


I’ve got to give a lot of credit to bloggers after this internship. I consider myself to be a decent writer, but I found it so incredibly difficult to string together a good blog post. It’s hard! My goal was to start an summer intern blog series, but that ended up being a series of 1. I had such a hard time finishing blog posts and finding the motivation to write them because I wasn’t excited about what I was writing about. It got to the point where I would just work on other projects or devote my time to tasks that were more fun to avoid working on my blog. 

I think I found the writing too similar to a college essay and must have had a natural distaste for the task. If I could go back I think I would dedicate more time to outlining my posts and try picking topics that I was actually interested in, and not just ones that I thought people would want to hear. I don’t think I would completely give up on writing blog posts, but maybe spend more time researching topics and organizing my thoughts. 


### What I Think I’ll Do Next


Right now my plan is to head back to Rhode Island and finish up my last year of undergrad. Like the summer, college has flown by and I just can’t believe I have one year left to figure out my next step. I don’t know exactly where I’ll end up or when, but I personally don’t believe I’m finished here yet. 

This summer I was a driving force behind launching the company Instagram, and it was a great feeling. I really felt in my element thinking of ideas and posts, and brainstorming ideas for our social media. It’s a little hard to let go after I’ve just started. Now that I’ve been a part of the Mautic team for three months, it’s difficult to know that the company is going to go on and grow without me (for a little bit). My hope is to come back in the winter and help out with any projects or events the Boston team may have. With only one more semester to go from then, I think I will have a really clear picture of what my next steps will be! 


### Where I See Mautic Going
  
 
I am not a tech person at all. I’ve said it once, but before my internship I did not know what marketing automation was at all. But look how far I’ve come! I think this Cinderella transformation says a lot not only about the software but about the people here at Mautic. If a simple gal like me can learn how to master this powerful and innovative software, then anyone can (and they should). 

I definitely could not have done it alone and I’m so glad I had the support of such a dedicated and motivated team. I saw a small (but growing) team of individuals come together and work relentlessly to perfect every aspect of this company small. Everyone here is motivated in helping Mautic reach its true potential and it’s a team that is truly dedicated to being just that, a team. 

![IGMautibot](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IGMautibot-1024x542.jpg)


Every [Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/trymautic) post I used [#movehorizons](https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/movehorizons/) and I loved the fact that I actually believed we could. I’m so happy that I got to work at a company where I truly believed in their power and potential. The phrase “there’s magic at Mautic” had been thrown around a lot, but for what probably won’t be the last time, I believe there is definitely magic at Mautic.

Not long ago we shared something that we feel very passionate about. That marketing needs to innovate at the speed of your customers. That it’s the expectation of every prospect and company. The relationship that each contact has with their company and the goals they share is not insignificant. It is important for every marketer to have proper context for each contact as it relates to the company they work for. You can call that good marketing, and proper foreshadowing. ;)

It goes without saying that what makes Mautic so powerful is you, the community. Each and every day we hear from people all over the world as they share their goals and aspirations. Leveraging the power of technology to make meaningful connections with their audience. Sharing these goals often result in brand new ideas for features that will equip not only you, but an entire business community with tools that make each connection more valuable. 

That’s why we’re excited to share the release of Mautic 2.2.0. Sure we’ve squashed a few bugs and added some new capabilities. But there are a handful of new features that we think will continue to set you and your marketing apart. 

------


**


### **Dynamic Email Content:**

We introduced dynamic content a couple of months ago in Mautic 2.0, but now there''s more. Users now have the ability to vary content in their email based on filters. Instead of creating multiple emails for slightly different messages, you can now save time by creating one email and can insert variations of content into the email! This means that at the time the email is sent, the content will become dynamic. Talk about personalization.  






**


### **Account Based Marketing:**

One of the most vital elements to B2B marketing is the ability to connect people together in the context of a company. We’ve created a new entity called ‘Companies’. Now every contact will be associated to a Company and users will have an all-company view of their contacts. This means not only will you be able to see all contacts associated with a company, but create filters and trigger actions based on company criteria! Now you can focus on nurturing, analyzing and converting a targeted group of accounts (or Companies) and implement Account Based Marketing practices. No more contact confusion.  






**


### **Recency/Frequency:**

More tools to show your contacts that you value their time and attention. For contacts subject to frequency limits, emails sent to them are now put in a queue to send once the limit timeframe has passed. You can now specify the priority on your marketing emails and prevent backlogs, ensuring important messages are sent in a timely, and respectful manner. Win, win!  






**


### **Update to Forms:**

The Mautic form experience has been vastly improved! You can now successfully pick a theme to apply to a form. In addition, results of a campaign form can be sent to a specified email address. Page breaks have been added making long forms more achievable. Now data from one form can be written to another! Syncing data between contact fields and forms has also been upgraded. Changes made to contact fields can now be easily written to forms, and values from a form can be transformed and written to contact fields. You can also further personalize thank you pages using tokens.

### **New Plugins:** (coming soon)

As if these features were not enough, we’ve created  two plugins for this release. The first is the Gmail plugin. This is a Chrome and Firefox plugin that will reveal timeline data from Mautic right in your browser. Also, when writing an email to a contact, the email can be tracked and written to the contact’s timeline in Mautic by clicking a checkbox. MS Outlook is our second plugin. Emails sent from Outlook can also be written to and tracked in Mautic. Be sure to add this functionality to provide even more contact detail.

### Community contributions

As we mentioned above, We get so excited to see our community getting involved in the development of Mautic. This release is no different. We’re thrilled to see a number of features contributed by the community in Mautic 2.2. They include:


- Ability to filter contacts based on tags
- Ability to send test emails to multiple recipients
- Improvements to bounce management and automatic unsubscription capability
- Ability to identify contacts that are in multiple segments
- Multi select fields on a contact, now available
- Ability to add points to a lead via the API
- Better identification of web visitors using cookies to identify the Mautic contact and further personalize the web experience on the user’s website
- Integration to Mailjet for sending emails
- Ability to schedule broadcast emails for self hosted Mautic
- mPower Focus now available on self hosted Mautic



Finally there are a number of updates that have made development in Mautic even better. Not only are we refactoring our code to make future development and testing easier, the community is also helping us make our code more efficient and has also resolved a number of small bugs.

With every release we want you to build momentum, generating more incredible value for your customers and contacts. The more equipped you are at making relevant, personalized connections with them, the more likely your business is to grow. 

Do you have a unique goal that marketing automation could help you accomplish? Share it with us. We’re always looking for new and innovative ways to make meaningful connections. 


### Mautic 2.2.0 Upgrade Details:


For more detailed information about the release for self-hosted users, please follow this link to the Mautic 2.2.0 [Release Notes](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/tag/2.2.0). Mautic Cloud users have already been updated to Mautic 2.2.0. If you experience any challenges accessing or using these incredible new features, please be sure to connect with us on [Slack](https://www.mautic.org/slack) and the [Community Forum](https://www.mautic.org/community).

Thank you for being an important part of the Mautic community!', '<img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/motorcycles-1620036_1920-1024x470.jpg" alt="motorcycles-1620036_1920" width="720" height="330" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-2500" />
Not long ago we shared something that we feel very passionate about. That marketing needs to innovate at the speed of your customers. That it’s the expectation of every prospect and company. The relationship that each contact has with their company and the goals they share is not insignificant. It is important for every marketer to have proper context for each contact as it relates to the company they work for. You can call that good marketing, and proper foreshadowing. ;)

It goes without saying that what makes Mautic so powerful is you, the community. Each and every day we hear from people all over the world as they share their goals and aspirations. Leveraging the power of technology to make meaningful connections with their audience. Sharing these goals often result in brand new ideas for features that will equip not only you, but an entire business community with tools that make each connection more valuable. 

That’s why we’re excited to share the release of Mautic 2.2.0. Sure we’ve squashed a few bugs and added some new capabilities. But there are a handful of new features that we think will continue to set you and your marketing apart.

<div class="media-body">
<h3 class="media-heading"><strong>Dynamic Email Content:</strong></h3>
<p class="lead">We introduced dynamic content a couple of months ago in Mautic 2.0, but now there''s more. Users now have the ability to vary content in their email based on filters. Instead of creating multiple emails for slightly different messages, you can now save time by creating one email and can insert variations of content into the email! This means that at the time the email is sent, the content will become dynamic. Talk about personalization.</p>
</div>

<div class="media">
<div class="pull-left"><i class="pe-7s-id" style="font-size: 48px;"></i></div>
<div class="media-body">
<h3 class="media-heading"><strong>Account Based Marketing:</strong></h3>
<p class="lead">One of the most vital elements to B2B marketing is the ability to connect people together in the context of a company. We’ve created a new entity called ‘Companies’. Now every contact will be associated to a Company and users will have an all-company view of their contacts. This means not only will you be able to see all contacts associated with a company, but create filters and trigger actions based on company criteria! Now you can focus on nurturing, analyzing and converting a targeted group of accounts (or Companies) and implement Account Based Marketing practices. No more contact confusion.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="media">
<div class="pull-left"><i class="pe-7s-clock" style="font-size: 48px;"></i></div>
<div class="media-body">
<h3 class="media-heading"><strong>Recency/Frequency:</strong></h3>
<p class="lead">More tools to show your contacts that you value their time and attention. For contacts subject to frequency limits, emails sent to them are now put in a queue to send once the limit timeframe has passed. You can now specify the priority on your marketing emails and prevent backlogs, ensuring important messages are sent in a timely, and respectful manner. Win, win!</p>
</div>

<div class="media">
<div class="pull-left"><i class="pe-7s-note" style="font-size: 48px;"></i></div>
<div class="media-body">
<h3 class="media-heading"><strong>Update to Forms:</strong></h3>
<p class="lead">The Mautic form experience has been vastly improved! You can now successfully pick a theme to apply to a form. In addition, results of a campaign form can be sent to a specified email address. Page breaks have been added making long forms more achievable. Now data from one form can be written to another! Syncing data between contact fields and forms has also been upgraded. Changes made to contact fields can now be easily written to forms, and values from a form can be transformed and written to contact fields. You can also further personalize thank you pages using tokens.</p>

As marketers, we live in an interesting time. Data collection is at an all time high and AI tools are growing at incredibly rapid pace.  And although 80% of consumers trust businesses with their personal information, it increasingly comes at a high cost. 


> For all industries and business segments that want to use personal data to enhance their own customer experiences, it’s important to remember that customers are willing to share their information if they know you are using it to help them get what they want... ([Source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/steveolenski/2016/04/18/for-consumers-data-is-a-matter-of-trust/#25ad698d8047))


The responsibility is on us, as organizations to provide value with the exchange of data. We must assure our customers that we not only see them, but we know *about* them; and there is a significant difference. It’s critical that we seek to understand their specific needs  at every step of the buying journey, from desktop to mobile and everywhere in between.


> No matter what innovations businesses set in front of consumers, and no matter how they try to serve them, customer expectations will accelerate. ([Source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marymeehan/2015/08/12/customer-expectation-trends-they-want-it-all-so-get-out-of-the-way/#573b68204a9f))


In the latest release, you will not only have access to more powerful information, but you can create a more connected, value-driven experience.  From integrations to more effective communication tools, you will be able to know more about your audience, not simply know them.


### Integrations:
 


- **Workflow Integrations:** There are 4 new plugins to integrate data from Citrix into Mautic. These include GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToAssist and GoToTraining. You can now automatically create contacts in Mautic when individuals register for your events in the Citrix tools from form data in Mautic. In addition, you can pull registrant and attendee data back from the Citrix tools into Mautic and trigger campaigns based on this information. The registration and attendance data is also stored as part of the contact’s timeline in Mautic, giving you more information at a glance.

- **Data Enhancement:** Data enhancement tools like FullContact and ClearBit can now be integrated with Mautic. Users of these services can enhance their contact and company data in Mautic by clicking buttons on the contact (or company) and bringing data in from those services. 

- **Accounts Integration:** Data from Salesforce Accounts can now be synched with Companies in Mautic. In addition we have optimized the API to minimize the number of API calls Mautic makes. Data from a new field type – formula fields – is also now available for mapping data between Salesforce and Mautic. Lastly Salesforce users can now access the timeline for the contact in Mautic by clicking on a link on the page in Salesforce. 



### Campaign Management:



- **Preference Center:** You can now collect preferences for your contacts in Mautic including  preferred channels, categories, timings and segments. This will help you manage delivery of more relevant messages, using channels the contact prefers. 

- **Account Based Marketing Update: **We have added a number of new features to Account Based Marketing. Companies in Mautic can now be merged; you now easily change the primary company on a contact; and you can apply a lead score at the company level. These features are in addition to a new set of reports that are available to measure performance at the company level.

- **Global Categories:** You can specify global categories across emails, landing pages, stages etc to categorize groups of entities in Mautic. You no longer need to define categories individually for each entity in Mautic, helping you stay organized and save you time.

- **Email/Landing Page Builder:** We''ve created an all new view for those who want to go under the hood and adjust HTML when developing emails and landing pages. The Content tab has been replaced with the new Code Mode view. This view will provide users with 2 panes in the Builder, one to edit the HTML directly and another to preview. Simply select Code Mode to start building, or to convert your existing communications into this view.



Each of these enhancements is another step toward smarter marketing. But with these tools come a greater responsibility to not only know our audience, but know their preferences and their needs as well. 

The Mautic 2.3 update has been made available to our Mautic Cloud and Self-hosted users. For more detailed information on this release, you can find the [release notes here](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/2.3.0).

Since the beginning, we built Mautic to be open and accessible. Other marketing automation systems limit what access and control users have over the data they gather. We make it a priority to provide you with as much access as possible to your information. All while providing you with industry leading features that make more meaningful connections with your audience. 

This release is no different. With Mautic 2.5 we’ve added additional data and reporting functionality while continuing to add features that will improve your best practices. 


### Data and Reporting



- Automatically send company details from Mautic to your connected CRM system.
- Export your contacts directly from the list view, or activity data from the contact detail page.
- Measure and report on even more email metrics, like link clicks.



### 
Features and Functionality



- Send email tests to multiple recipients, not just to the user creating the test.
- For those who use Mailjet, you can now test your Mautic campaigns using Sandbox mode. 
- Turn on single sign-on (SSO) using SAML. *(Feature not available on Mautic Cloud Free accounts)*
- Place forms and focus items into dynamic content.
- Trigger activities using custom date fields and automatically send birthday or anniversary emails through a campaign. 



Marketers must be better equipped to meet the needs of their audience online. Each connection you make with your customer requires even more relevance and personalization. With a more agile approach to development, you’ll begin to see more frequent updates giving you an even more open, integrated solution that drives audience engagement. 

The Mautic 2.5 update has been released to Mautic Cloud and self-hosted users. For more information about this update, please check the [release notes here](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/tag/2.5.0).

I think we all recognize that marketing is not without it’s challenges. As our strategies and tools become more diversified, so do our resources and even our messages do as well. Even though the tactics become more complex, one goal remains; to create a holistic customer experience that reflects our core messages, while catering to our audience on a personal level.

While this goal is admirable it often reveals gaps. We do our best to identify them and work to minimize them. Our social media efforts drive customer engagement. Our email campaigns seek to engage customers all throughout the funnel. But are we truly maximizing each and every touch point - leveraging communications at each stage of the buying cycle? 

The focus of the latest product development sprint has been to both eliminate pesky bugs and equip marketers with solutions. Solutions that will help bridge some of these communication gaps and deliver a more holistic customer experience. The new features and capabilities found in Mautic 2.6 will help you create more flexible, succinct and tailored marketing messages for your audience.


### Holistic Marketing Messages:




- Create messages in one place that work across multiple channels
- Trigger *Marketing Messages* within a campaign that specify unique communications for individual channels
- Allow contacts to choose their channel of communications




### Enhanced Campaign Reporting:




- Access brand new data source called Campaigns in the Reports view
- View metrics on individual campaign components and channels
- Create reports to understand overall campaign performance



With Marketing Messages and better Campaign Reporting, Mautic will help you begin to close  the gaps in your marketing communications. Campaign reporting will give you the metrics you need to assess each area of your campaign, closing the knowledge gap. And with Marketing Messages, you’ll be more targeted than ever, closing the relevance gap and letting your audience know you’re listening.

As marketers strive for creativity in the way they engage and connect with their audience, they are continuously looking for opportunities to save time and be more efficient. Who isn’t? We all add resources, tools and processes in an effort to accomplish more. That includes marketing automation. 

Since Mautic was first conceived, usability has been a strategic imperative. Each feature and bug fix is designed and implemented in a way that re-enforces our goal of saving time and improving the user experience. Our latest release is no different. It not only checks bugs off the list, the process of automating multi-channel communications keeps getting easier and easier. 


### Better Salesforce Mapping:



- Integrations should make sharing information easy. We’ve created a new interface for mapping fields between Mautic and Salesforce that makes the process a snap. Not only that, but you can now specify which system is the master for each mapped field. So if you determine that a contact phone number can only be updated in Salesforce, this data will flow from Salesforce to Mautic and not the other way around. 




### Improving the Editor Experience:



- The email and landing page editors have gotten a usability facelift. New types of content slots are available to help create and design the most engaging assets possible. Easily create and add different types of content such as images, text, social follows and gated video. We’ve also included the ability to add multi-column sections giving you more flexibility in designing your page or email.



Release 2.7 saves time and streamlines workflow, making incredible strides in improving usability for marketers. This release is now available for [download](https://www.mautic.org/download) to our open source community, and is now live for our Mautic Cloud users.

Digital marketer Gary Vaynerchuk once said, “[marketers ruin everything](https://www.mautic.org/blog/how-to-make-marketing-automation-personal/)”. And in a sense he’s right. We need to be thoughtful about our approach to every audience interaction.

In the days leading up to digital sales and marketing, the term improvisation (or improv), often took the role of the savvy salesperson who was able to think quickly on their feet in a sales presentation, or the marketer who was able to think outside the box. Improv has many attributes, but can automation be one of them? 


### The Art of Improv


The value that improv provides is the element of surprise and delight. But this value isn’t based on random or arbitrary activity. It’s based on a few core elements that are second nature to the people who are able to deliver it.



- **Listening for relevance:**
One of the key elements of improv in a comedy context is that one person needs to listen and truly understand where the other person is leading the dialogue. This is why marketing automation should never be a solo proposition. To be truly effective in improv, you must listen to other actors and determine their role and how you will interact with them. To create moments of improvisation you must first listen.

- **Know Your Audience:**
In any field where communication is relied upon to provide value, listening and understanding who you’re speaking to are key. Have they experienced what you’ve experienced? Whether it’s a group of realtors or bodybuilders, what each group finds humorous will be unique. The connections we make with them must reflect our knowledge of who they are.

- **Follow the flow:**
When you’re doing improv, it’s necessary that your story have a rhythm or a cadence. It’s in this flow of story that an audience will find connection. If you’ve ever been to an evening of improv, you’ll notice that there is a broader story being told. The flow of a story will ultimately engage you in meaningful ways. Breaking this pattern or flow will leave audiences feeling disconnected.

- **Delight with a payoff:**
There are many times throughout an improvisational skit or comedy routine where there’s a moment of delight or a comedic payoff.  It often leaves the audience even more engaged and connected to the story being told. This is one of the most important elements of improv. It''s the response that our [amygdala](http://www.livescience.com/13529-insights-brain-region-aha-moments.html) reacts to. It''s the part of your brain that helps evaluate if something is memorable and full of delight. 

 

Improv is part art and part science. It’s not something that can simply be calculated or easily produced. It comes with practice and a keen awareness of these elements. Now let’s take a look at each of these elements in the light of how we automate our marketing and communications.


### Automating Improv


Automation continues to be seen as a calculated prescription of actions that are a result of someone’s choice. These seem in complete contrast to the ebb and flow of a improv comedy routine. Or are they? Let’s consider the factors of improv that we’ve highlighted and determine if there is a place in our marketing automation for them.



- **Listening for relevance:**
One of the things that we often miss when developing our automation workflows is a close relationship with the other functions of our business that provide us with real-time feedback. Integrations become a key way for businesses to assess relevance throughout the entire product lifecycle. Are you working with other teams in your business? If you''re able to check for whether an email has been opened or a link has been clicked, what other actions/activities can provide feedback? Payment received? Order processed? Shipment delivered? Consider what notifications can be leveraged to help you make the most meaningful connection.

- **Know Your Audience:**
This seems fairly intuitive. When someone clicks on a link, visits a page or fills out a form, it begins to indicate intent or motivation. Your audience is providing you with all manner of information that will help you learn more about them. Knowing this information gives you information with which to validate interest. Are you leveraging each marketing channel and function in your business to truly understand them?

- **Follow the Flow:**
Consider flow akin to your buying journey. One of the real challenges of improv is the ability to combine all of these factors into a relevant story. The same is true of marketing automation. Follow your visitor/customer as they make decisions. As you do, be sure to provide value at each milestone. Allow their decisions and your value to steer them into opportunities for delight.

- **Delight with a Payoff:**
We all know that with improv the payoff is the punchline or the big finish. As we consider marketing’s role in engaging our audience and maximizing resources with automation, we must use these tools to engage our audience, not simply move them through a funnel. Whether you are listening for keywords, monitoring for clicks, be intentional by identifying specific segments or customers to provide truly delight filled moments.



Many organizations are joining the marketing automation movement. They''re taking their simple, routine communications and moving them into an automation system. This is not altogether a bad thing. But the opportunity cost may be greater than anticipated if marketing teams don’t find improvisational ways to make automation a value added part of their marketing strategy. Here''s our chance to take the stage and make each interaction one they won''t soon forget.', 'Marketing automation may still be in it’s infancy, but it has already garnered a reputation for being a cold, calculated tool in the hands of marketers.

One of the key attributes of Mautic is the ability to integrate with several digital sales and marketing solutions. From web conferencing tools to CRM’s, we are always interested to hear how organizations are using Mautic and leveraging this capability to maximize their marketing. 

We recently had the opportunity to sit down with Mike Seidle, cofounder of WorkHere to learn more about their business and how they use Mautic.

We’ve either been there, or know others who’ve been there. Without a job. With so many solutions designed to help people find them, it’s hard to believe that another solution is needed. But the data has proved that theory wrong. By looking at over 15 years of information from different sources, the WorkHere team saw that individuals were looking for jobs focused primarily on one thing: Location.

And that was the impetus for WorkHere, a mobile application and website designed to help workers with job titles like truck driver, nurse, machine operator, etc. find a job, and find it in their own back yard. While strategically focusing on the state of Indiana, the team worked closely with employers, education, government and the National Labor Exchange to develop a solution to provide access to jobs available online and offline. What started in Indiana has now grown to reach communities around the entire United States.

With its value proposition and business growing, keeping costs under control was an important part of the equation. That’s when they discovered Mautic. And they haven’t looked back. 

When the time came to start selling to employers, WorkHere needed a CRM. One of the main factors in selecting Zoho CRM was Mautic’s existing Zoho CRM integration. According to WorkHere’s Seidle, “We were able to use Mautic to build triggered adaptive campaigns that pushed leads right into our CRM. The whole setup took us about 30 minutes.”

“We were able to use Mautic to build triggered adaptive campaigns that pushed leads right into our CRM. The whole setup took us about 30 minutes.” - Mike Seidle


Currently WorkHere uses Mautic for nearly all their end user communication and engagement. They’re able to place forms on their website and in their progressive mobile app, that provides data directly to Mautic, giving them a 360-degree view of when, where and how users are connecting with the service.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/WorkhereGraphic_WP-1024x512.png)


WorkHere also leverages the power of campaigns to ensure that users are keeping their profiles up to date and providing the most current information for employers. If a user fills out a profile but forgets to add other information employers would be interested in, Mautic will send out reminders to complete their profile.

Mike and their team of 13 believe they have a great thing going. And the results are showing. In just under a year they have over 42,000 workers and have signed over 100 paying employers, many of them well known high volume employers including household names in logistics, healthcare, retail and hospitality. 

We’re excited to see how Mike and the WorkHere team continue to leverage Mautic and their integrations to provide the most relevant opportunities to job seekers. For more information on WorkHere, you can find them at their website, [workhere.com](http://www.workhere.com).

With its value proposition and business growing, keeping costs under control was an important part of the equation. That’s when they discovered Mautic. And they haven’t looked back. 

When the time came to start selling to employers, WorkHere needed a CRM. One of the main factors in selecting Zoho CRM was Mautic’s existing Zoho CRM integration. According to WorkHere’s Seidle, “We were able to use Mautic to build triggered adaptive campaigns that pushed leads right into our CRM. The whole setup took us about 30 minutes.”

Currently WorkHere uses Mautic for nearly all their end user communication and engagement. They’re able to place forms on their website and in their progressive mobile app, that provides data directly to Mautic, giving them a 360-degree view of when, where and how users are connecting with the service.

WorkHere also leverages the power of campaigns to ensure that users are keeping their profiles up to date and providing the most current information for employers. If a user fills out a profile but forgets to add other information employers would be interested in, Mautic will send out reminders to complete their profile.

Mike and their team of 13 believe they have a great thing going. And the results are showing. In just under a year they have over 42,000 workers and have signed over 100 paying employers, many of them well known high volume employers including household names in logistics, healthcare, retail and hospitality. 

We’re excited to see how Mike and the WorkHere team continue to leverage Mautic and their integrations to provide the most relevant opportunities to job seekers. For more information on WorkHere, you can find them at their website, <a href="http://www.workhere.com">workhere.com</a>.

As marketers we are quick to strategize, then become hyper focused on tactics. Building successful campaigns, targeting the right segment and launching the best creative. We sit in meetings discussing the best use of language and critiquing fonts and visuals trying to solicit a meaningful reaction. While these efforts are all worthwhile, we must always consider them in light of solving the larger challenge. 

When it comes to rolling up our sleeves and getting to the business of marketing, we certainly know how to execute. We are trained to ask probing questions to understand our audience, where they are in the buying journey and capturing their attention. This is now becoming true of marketing automation. 



*“What does the data say?”*
*“What were the results of the A/B test?”*
*“Did our content strategy work in the last campaign?”*


The list goes on. While we are becoming great inquisitors, are we truly solving for the big why? When we consider marketing automation and its role in our business, we should first reflect on it’s purpose. It''s only then that we can fully tap into it''s full potential, lest we relegate it to an auto email responder.

We believe that marketing automation should be more than a bolt on solution. It should be an integrated part of your overall business strategy. Our latest release continues to equip your business with the tools you need to bring that strategy to life.


### Enhancements



- **Mail is Owner:**  Emails can now be sent from different senders who are owners of the contact, creating a more personalized experience for your audience. This means if a sales rep is the contact owner, a single email send can appear as though it came from that individual.   
- **Tweet Entity:** Not all tweets are created equal. Recognizing the vital role of social media, it would be simple to create a generic interaction via Twitter. However this doesn’t support an integrated way of thinking. A new channel called ‘tweet’ is available to create tweets to send as part of campaigns. Unique tweets can be created, modified and managed from this new channel.  
- **Campaign Reporting:** Channel and component reports can now be filtered for a campaign. A column called campaign has been added to email asset, landing page and form reports to enable the user to analyze these in the context of a campaign. Powerful flexibility that gives you greater clarity in your marketing.

- **Custom Fields:** Customizing Mautic to meet the needs of your business is important. And measuring them is even more important. Now you can include your custom fields into your reports giving you more valuable insights.
- **Summary Columns:** But it doesn’t stop there. Now you can summarize data in reports using the “group by” feature and calculated fields. What does this mean? This enables the user to create relevant summaries for your detailed reports.  
- **Editor Enhancements:** The editor continues to grow. We’ve added two new slots to provide even more customization. The code mode slot lets you put in raw html into the builder giving you needed flexibility. In addition, the dynamic content slot can now be created and edited right from the builder.   
- **GoToWebinar confirmation link:** The GoToWebinar integration has added capability. You can now insert the personalized confirmation link as part of followup emails, creating a seamless user experience.
 


### Integrations



- **Salesforce **


- Campaigns: Mautic now supports a bi-directional integration with Salesforce Campaigns! You can create a segment in Mautic and trigger a campaign based on campaign members from a Salesforce Campaign. You can also add contacts as campaign members in a Salesforce Campaign from a Mautic campaign or form action. Extending the integration far beyond sharing of contact, account, and lead detail. 
- **Contact link:** More Salesforce integration support! Now you can map the Mautic timeline link to a custom field in Salesforce to allow users (like your sales team) view that contact’s activities timeline directly from Salesforce. More data at your fingertips to encourage personalized conversations throughout the buying process!


- **One Signal**


- **Web Notifications:** You can now user your own OneSignal account with Mautic to send Web notifications as part of campaigns.
- **Mobile Push Notifications:** Mobile app push notifications are here! Use the One Signal plugin to send mobile push notifications to your iOS or Android app. Now you can create, send and track mobile notifications in Mautic.


- **Twilio for SMS:** Mautic can now connect to your Twilio account. If your contacts would like to receive communications via SMS, you can connect your Twilio account with Mautic and send SMS messages as part of campaigns. More integrations mean more relevance and personalization.



 
Whether you are moving prospects through a meaningful buying journey, or adding value at each stage, each area of execution requires a thoughtful consideration of the larger problem you are solving. That makes the tactics of marketing more significant.

We trust that these features, improvements and bug fixes will enable you and your entire business to respond to to each problem statement with clear focus and attention.

Release 2.8 encourages big picture thinking, while taking incredible strides to bring that picture to life for marketers.

Unless you’ve been avoiding the news for the last couple of weeks, you’ve most likely seen all sorts of troubling stories surrounding customers who have been treated poorly by various airlines. If you’ve missed them here are a few;



**[California Family Kicked Off Delta Flight After Argument Over Toddler’s Seat](http://www.newsweek.com/schear-family-kicked-delta-air-lines-594990)**

**[American Airlines investigates after video shows mom in tears](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/22/us/american-airlines-video-confrontation-trnd/)**

**[Delta Employees Asked Man to Leave Flight After Using Restroom](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/delta-employees-asked-man-lhttp://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/delta-employees-asked-man-leave-flight-after-using-restroom-videos-n751811eave-flight-after-using-restroom-videos-n751811)**

**[United Airlines Passenger Is Dragged From an Overbooked Flight](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/10/business/united-flight-passenger-dragged.html)**



I don’t share these incidents to bring judgement upon the airlines or its passengers. The reason I share this is because I think as marketers, we can learn a lot from these situations. We can learn from innovative successes and groundbreaking products, as well as communication breakdowns and errors in judgement. Each of these stories should cause us to reflect and have meaningful discussions in our businesses.

As we consider each of these incidents, what is one thing they have in common? They reflect a breakdown in the customer journey. You’re likely saying, “Yes, we know all about the customer journey, there’s no problem here. We understand the touchpoints, as well as how we engage customers along each step of that journey.” That''s great. However, have you put your customer journey in front of your customer? Would they agree with each touchpoint? Have you considered missing touchpoints that maybe only your customer sees? The director of marketing at each of these airlines likely did not see the journey that included unhappy customers that are asked to voluntarily leave their flights each and every day. 

So what does this mean for our marketing automation efforts? We should consider this a wake up call to how we engage our customers at each and every step and with each and every interaction. And that includes the interactions we may not always see or acknowledge.


- 
#### Re-assess the Customer Journey:

Your customer and marketplace are not, and should not be, static. If the way your customers find, access or engage you continues to evolve, then so should your customer journey. 


> “A customer is never on a predetermined course – they are unpredictable! By ‘understanding the customer journey’ brands run the risk of pigeon holing their customers and losing them, by trying to control the process.” ([source](https://www.digitalmarketing-conference.com/customer-journey-no-longer-linear-brands-must-evolve/))


This is significant. Don’t get lulled to sleep by believing that once you’ve outlined your customer journey that it is in “set it and forget” mode. There is a risk to not consistently evaluating each touchpoint. Even touchpoints you think don’t exist.

- 
#### Review the Data and Verify:

One of the most valuable elements of marketing automation is the ability to segment and communicate directly to the needs of our audience. But how often are we reviewing the data and verifying that the value is meaningful?


> “If the enterprise does not augment the product experience with accurate, timely, and relevant information (according to the user’s location, channel and time of usage), users will be left dissatisfied, disoriented, and disengaged.” ([source](https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/01/data-analysis-drives-customer-journey/))


Don’t forget to periodically monitor click throughs and open rates to ensure your content is adding value to your segments at each and every stage.

- 
#### Find the Gaps:

As you reassess your customer journey, not only must you constantly be speaking with you customer facing team, but you must be speaking directly with customers at each stage of the customer journey. Why did that potential customer not place an order? Were there unmet needs? Are there touchpoints that we haven’t addressed? 


> “As part of this 360-degree view of the customer, brands need to connect data from both physical and digital touchpoints in order to bridge the gap between the two.” ([source](http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/3-ways-to-close-gaps-in-the-customer-journey/))


These gaps reside in our day-to-day interactions with customers, but also in the digital handoffs that occur as we provide our products and services.

- 
#### Add Value at Every Stage:

Whether your customers are loyal or encounter an unforeseen roadblock, it is incumbent upon you to add value. We are in a sharing economy. The challenge we face as marketers is that every potential customer should be seen as a potential advocate for our business whether they are a customer or not.


> “The art of creating added value starts with the ability to see your business through the eyes of your customers.” ([source](http://www.verticalresponse.com/blog/5-ways-to-create-added-value-for-customers/))


So walk in their shoes, talk with them directly. Sometimes the best data is not in a report, but directly interacting with the people you serve. 



In summary, what can we learn from the challenges airlines have been experiencing over the past couple of weeks? That no matter how long you’ve been doing business, and what you think you know about your customers, there is always an opportunity to learn more and improve the customer journey before, during and after they interact with your business.

INSERT INTO mtorg_db.rainlab_blog_posts (id, user_id, title, slug, excerpt, content, content_html, published_at, published, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (2843, 0, 'Mautic Landing Pages; The Designer’s Checklist', 'mautic-landing-pages-the-designers-checklist', '', '![landing pages](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/windowsDesignBlogPost-1024x488.jpg)

*We are excited to share a post that was written by Betty Chatzisavvidou, a member of the Mautic community in Europe. *

Landing Pages are a primary Marketing online tool. Most of the time they are the first visual element that a visitor experiences of your brand. While landing pages are usually designed to be informative, they must also focus on the action expected - completing a form, signing up to a mailing list or purchasing a product, for example.

The biggest challenge faced by the designer is to create a landing page that looks good, but also converts well.

The Mautic marketing automation platform provides the perfect technology platform to convert an anonymous visitor into a potential lead, but the designer is the person who has the power to make that happen.




### 1. Design for the technology platform


Landing pages may be short and to the point, or they may be long-form, engaging the visitor and providing various sources of information to help the visitor come to a decision. 

Whether short or long form, navigation plays a critical role in focusing the user on completing the action for which the page is intended. If your visitors will only be spending a few seconds on the page, the design elements must help them to find their way to the relevant information and action points. 

As a designer, we try to convey a story through the elements we place on the page, using structure to guide the flow between different chapters in the story, and explaining points which may not be obvious to the reader.


### 1. Design


At Virya Group our focus is on keeping things simple. Our main goal is to create theme which are clean, functional and with minimal distraction.

All our theme designs adhere to research-driven best practices related to landing pages. By dispensing with the fluff and keeping only the essential requirements, we focus on directing visitors’ attention to the appropriate page elements. 

In most cases, this will be a call to action such as a button, special offer, lead capture form or video. 

It is also important to cater for any eventuality. Each theme we design comes with a library of elements to choose from. This includes design guidance on everything from the weight of fonts to the styling of a table and the dimensions of images on a photo slider. 

We try to ensure that we design everything with a focus on the experience of the visitor to the landing page and the flexibility that our end-users might require when customising the ‘off-the-shelf’ or bespoke themes that we provide.


### 1. The Form


No matter what the goal of your campaign is, a great landing page needs to push your visitor to take a specific action and in many cases, this will be through a lead capture form. 

The most important element of the landing page; the lead capture form presents a trigger. By this point (thanks to your awesome design work!) visitors are highly motivated to do something (complete the form) and the task now is to make sure that it is super easy, clear, and a nice experience to complete that action.

Sometimes we might add an extra convincer reminding them what they are getting when completing the form, but we always make sure the process is smooth, easy to understand and seamless. 

It’s easy to forget the importance of the button on the form - but this is a vital ‘call to action’ - and an opportunity to remind the visitor what they will receive on completing the form. 

From the designers perspective a good colour contrast with the background and a careful choice of wording are the two ingredients that will communicate clearly your goal and ensure the conversion takes place. Don’t just leave it at ‘submit’!


### 1. The Language


Here we shift our attention from pixels to people. In Mautic landing pages we want to focus on using a certain language, which builds trust between the brand, product or service and the visitors. 

As a designer, we need to think like the potential customers, determining what they need to see and what we want to communicate so that they fully engage with the value proposition on this landing page. We try to keep the language simple, describing why the product or service meets their needs or solves their pain-point, with no use of complex language. 

Headers, sub-headers and text are structured to highlight for the reader any important messages. 

Well designed Mautic landing pages allow you to communicate your value proposition clearly, without burying the visitor under piles of irrelevant information.


### 1. Mobile First


Mautic landing pages should be designed with mobile in mind - if they are going to be used to target a mobile audience. As this segment is growing rapidly, it is an important factor when preparing visuals for a landing page. 

Mobile visitors need to have the same kind of guidance throughout the page, be able to access the same resources, and have the same compulsion to complete the action as their desktop counterparts. 

Designing for mobile devices is not simply about moving blocks around to fit a smaller screen, but must focus on a deep awareness of the behaviour differences on mobile as opposed to desktop devices.


### 1. Test


With the growing importance of fast-loading web pages and a need to do everything possible to ensure a conversion when a visitor lands on your page, the overall page size is an important consideration.

Multiple studies have shown that landing pages which take a long time to load result in less conversions. 

Optimisation in this regard involves a lot of testing, but also close communication between the designer and the developer to ensure that visuals are delivered in the most efficient way - for example using a single SVG image and applying CSS to select the relevant image, or making sure that the images are rendered and provided in the resolution that is required, rather than in maximum resolution. 

Testing does not stop with page speed, however. Full testing should also include running A/B tests to determine the best button placement, applying design knowledge to identify the best colour choice, icons and photos, making sure that the typography is appropriate for the purpose of the page, and of course once the page is developed, ensuring legibility, navigation flows and of course interaction on any device or browser. 

When the needs of the visitor are combined with the designer’s qualitative understanding of them, and a thorough understanding of the market, the results can be spectacular.

<em>We are excited to share a post that was written by Betty Chatzisavvidou, a member of the Mautic community in Europe. </em>

Landing Pages are a primary Marketing online tool. Most of the time they are the first visual element that a visitor experiences of your brand. While landing pages are usually designed to be informative, they must also focus on the action expected - completing a form, signing up to a mailing list or purchasing a product, for example.

The biggest challenge faced by the designer is to create a landing page that looks good, but also converts well.

The Mautic marketing automation platform provides the perfect technology platform to convert an anonymous visitor into a potential lead, but the designer is the person who has the power to make that happen.

<ol>
<h3><li>Design for the technology platform</h3>

Landing pages may be short and to the point, or they may be long-form, engaging the visitor and providing various sources of information to help the visitor come to a decision. 

Whether short or long form, navigation plays a critical role in focusing the user on completing the action for which the page is intended. If your visitors will only be spending a few seconds on the page, the design elements must help them to find their way to the relevant information and action points. 

As a designer, we try to convey a story through the elements we place on the page, using structure to guide the flow between different chapters in the story, and explaining points which may not be obvious to the reader.</li>

<h3><li>Design</h3>

At Virya Group our focus is on keeping things simple. Our main goal is to create theme which are clean, functional and with minimal distraction.

All our theme designs adhere to research-driven best practices related to landing pages. By dispensing with the fluff and keeping only the essential requirements, we focus on directing visitors’ attention to the appropriate page elements. 

In most cases, this will be a call to action such as a button, special offer, lead capture form or video. </li>

It is also important to cater for any eventuality. Each theme we design comes with a library of elements to choose from. This includes design guidance on everything from the weight of fonts to the styling of a table and the dimensions of images on a photo slider. 

We try to ensure that we design everything with a focus on the experience of the visitor to the landing page and the flexibility that our end-users might require when customising the ‘off-the-shelf’ or bespoke themes that we provide.

<h3><li>The Form</h3>

No matter what the goal of your campaign is, a great landing page needs to push your visitor to take a specific action and in many cases, this will be through a lead capture form. 

The most important element of the landing page; the lead capture form presents a trigger. By this point (thanks to your awesome design work!) visitors are highly motivated to do something (complete the form) and the task now is to make sure that it is super easy, clear, and a nice experience to complete that action.

Sometimes we might add an extra convincer reminding them what they are getting when completing the form, but we always make sure the process is smooth, easy to understand and seamless. 

It’s easy to forget the importance of the button on the form - but this is a vital ‘call to action’ - and an opportunity to remind the visitor what they will receive on completing the form. 

From the designers perspective a good colour contrast with the background and a careful choice of wording are the two ingredients that will communicate clearly your goal and ensure the conversion takes place. Don’t just leave it at ‘submit’!

<h3><li>The Language</h3>

Here we shift our attention from pixels to people. In Mautic landing pages we want to focus on using a certain language, which builds trust between the brand, product or service and the visitors. 

As a designer, we need to think like the potential customers, determining what they need to see and what we want to communicate so that they fully engage with the value proposition on this landing page.

------

Are you afraid that your email marketing efforts using Mautic will be affected by spam bots? Wish that there was another alternative that didn''t involve CAPTCHAs? Research shows that CAPTCHAs are having a negative impact on conversions. 


> The short story is that CAPTCHAs kill conversions. ([source](https://medium.com/rareview/why-your-captcha-is-killing-conversions-f9be6fe17d1f))


The pain is even bigger if you have a high traffic website and use external email services like Amazon SES, Sendgrid and Sparkpost. If you don’t control these spam bots, you won''t be in compliance with their spam rules.

You know what? You aren’t alone.


### Honeypot Method


There is a way to get past this struggle, even if you are not a developer. The solution is to implement an approach called the Honeypot method, in your Mautic forms.

First, login to your Mautic instance. Go to **Settings** (cog icon), then **Custom Fields**. In the Custom Field window, add a new field.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-10.54.52-AM-copy-1024x495.png)


In the **Label** field lets call this **honey**, click **Save & Close**, and continue to the next step.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Screen-Shot-2017-05-25-at-10.57.18-AM-copy.png)



### The Setup


Now, let''s go to the forms we need to protect using the honeypot method. I would suggest going to the forms that are more prone to attack.

Add a new email field in the forms and select call it **email2** and map that field to the honey field we created.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Peek-2017-05-18-13-09.gif)


Now in Mautic v2.8+ we have a new field type called **HTML Area**, we''re going to use this field and add the follow code in the HTML area;

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Peek-2017-05-18-13-404.gif)



```
<style>
#mauticform_label_formname_honeypot { display:none; } 
#mauticform_input_formname_fieldlabel { display:none; } 
#mauticform_label_formname_fieldlabel { display:none; } 
</style>
```


This code will make the **email2** field invisible to the human eye, but not for the spam bots.

------
***NOTE:** You have to replace the **formname** and **fieldlabel** with the form name without space and the field label in your honeypot filed you put in your Mautic.

Another approach to hiding the field would be to specify the **Field Container Attribute** of the **email2** field you want to hide as:
```
style="display:none"
```
*
------
Now let''s start eliminating spam bots.


### Eliminate the Spam


Go to all the campaigns you have attached to a Campaign form;

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Peek-2017-05-18-16-54.gif)


Now adding this condition at the first step of the campaign will check to see if the person that submits the form has information in the field "honey". If the field is empty it is likely a real person. If it''s not empty, it is a spam-bot and we are going to delete it.

**NOTE:** If you use a **Standalone Form** and you have the action to send email to user you MUST disable this and create a campaign associate with this **Standalone Form** and replicate the step above.

Using the honeypot method will help you stop spam bots and the negative effect they have on your email marketing activities.

It’s been nearly three years since Mautic''s founder David Hurley sat down and penned [the first post on Mautic](https://www.mautic.org/blog/and-so-it-begins/). Since that time, it’s been a season of tremendous growth and learning as we set out to provide every business with a marketing automation solution that was best in class…and free!

As I reflect on that post, we find ourselves meeting and in many cases exceeding our expectations. We are indeed meeting the needs of small businesses, adding incredible features and gaining access to bigger markets. But this has not happened without the incredible support from our community. 

With every update, we see individual names of people who are making incredible contributions to Mautic. Every time I survey the forums or Slack, there are passionate, driven people who have dedicated themselves to see this community and solution grow.

But this growth hasn’t been without it’s challenges. Developing a feature rich solution that meets the demands of a growing industry, while tackling the many bugs that gets in the way, can be trying. But we are as committed as ever to listening to you, responding to your needs and exceeding user expectations, every step of the way.

It’s clear to us that real focus is needed in the community. This is simply a reality of our rapid growth. We realize that more resources are needed to bring value, while creating a place where each member is represented and recognized.

To that end, I’ve been asked to lead the community management effort at Mautic. Since I began working at Mautic over a year ago, I’ve been working in a number of capacities, but have developed a real passion for engaging our community and fostering relationships that connect people to value, while equipping them to add their own. 

There are a number of key growth areas that we’d like to tackle in the near term. But in order to be successful, it requires input and support from the entire community. To that end, we will be reaching out in a focused way to solicit that feedback regarding these areas soon. They include;



- **Forums:** One of the ways we engage as a community is by connecting with one another via our forums. Unfortunately the existing forum application limits us from accomplishing other things like recognizing contributors, up-voting specific problems and so much more. We’d like to explore other tools that will bring even more value to the community in this area.

- **Onboarding:** This continues to be an area we’re excited about further developing. The current onboarding process is challenging at best, and we recognize it needs to be addressed. Our goal is to make every new user to Mautic feel supported while setting up, configuring and running their very first campaign. We’ll be taking steps to assess, review, edit and develop more succinct tools.

- **Marketplace:** A community’s strength is found in how it brings value to every member. We continue to believe that Mautic’s greatest strength is in it’s people. The ones who contribute value each and every day. Whether it’s answering a question, or solving a technical challenge, we believe that the value chain should be reciprocal. So we’ll be exploring ways to bring the marketplace to life this year.



I have reached out to many of you already in an effort to ensure that everyone that connects with Mautic, feels supported to grow their business. But if I haven''t connected with you, I''d like to say "hello" and please feel free to reach out to me (via [Slack](https://www.mautic.org/slack): @jseevers or [email](mailto:jeff.seevers@mautic.org)) and introduce yourself, or provide a comment below.

*Originally published at [dbhurley.com](http://dbhurley.com/upcoming-mautic-ama/).*

2017 is drawing to a close and it’s been a whirlwind of a year. There’s been so much going on in the Mautic universe it can be a bit overwhelming. Whether you’ve been around for the entire ride, or just joined us I have no doubt that you may have a few questions about things.

As you may have begun to notice I’ve been ramping up my efforts on sharing information. One of my focuses, as we close out this year and start the next year, involves how to empower more people in our amazing Mautic community. To that end I have been working on the best way to share information, organize my thoughts, and help get everyone on the same page in terms of Mautic: where we are, where we’ve been, and possibly most importantly – where we are going. I’ve shared several posts recently on my blog ([here](http://dbhurley.com/standardizing-github-for-product-management/), [here](http://dbhurley.com/creating-the-mautic-credit-system/), and [here](http://dbhurley.com/recognizing-mautic-code-contributors/)) which give a few insights but I believe there are even more ways I can improve. Because I think there are probably still questions outstanding that haven’t been answered yet.

So, in order to help with that I am preparing to do something for the first time in Mautic history. <span style="background-color: yellow;">I am excited to announce our first ever <strong>AMA</strong></span> (ask me anything). This will be an opportunity for you to ask your questions directly and **hopefully** get immediate answers. There’s general guidelines for the session and of course, any deep technical questions or bugs you just want solved are not really the purpose of this time. **To put it bluntly, I won’t be “live fixing” anyone’s website.  **?

However, questions about how Mautic should be used, ways to get involved, questions about the roadmap, our community future, leadership structure, GitHub projects etc…these are all welcome topics and I will do my best to give you good, clear, concise answers. And I give you my word, if I don’t have an answer – I’ll be honest enough to tell you I don’t know and point you to a resource that might be able to help.

> The goal of this AMA is to ensure our global community, and you as an individual, feel confident in what we’re doing and also where we’re going. I hope this will be a fun, enjoyable and informative session where we can all learn and improve.

And lastly, if all goes well I hope we will hold more of these in the future. I’m not going to dig into specifics about what to expect (Remember this is our first one, we’re going to be learning as we go). But here’s what you need to know now:

2017 is drawing to a close and it’s been a whirlwind of a year. There’s been so much going on in the Mautic universe it can be a bit overwhelming. Whether you’ve been around for the entire ride, or just joined us I have no doubt that you may have a few questions about things.

As you may have begun to notice I’ve been ramping up my efforts on sharing information. One of my focuses, as we close out this year and start the next year, involves how to empower more people in our amazing Mautic community. To that end I have been working on the best way to share information, organize my thoughts, and help get everyone on the same page in terms of Mautic: where we are, where we’ve been, and possibly most importantly – where we are going. I’ve shared several posts recently on my blog (<a href="http://dbhurley.com/standardizing-github-for-product-management/">here</a>, <a href="http://dbhurley.com/creating-the-mautic-credit-system/">here</a>, and <a href="http://dbhurley.com/recognizing-mautic-code-contributors/">here</a>) which give a few insights but I believe there are even more ways I can improve. Because I think there are probably still questions outstanding that haven’t been answered yet.

So, in order to help with that I am preparing to do something for the first time in Mautic history. <span style="background-color: yellow;">I am excited to announce our first ever <strong>AMA</strong></span> (ask me anything). This will be an opportunity for you to ask your questions directly and <strong>hopefully</strong> get immediate answers.

As we reach the end of 2017 people everywhere will begin looking back on the previous year and their accomplishments. The highs and the lows will be analyzed and reviewed. Assessments over what was successful shared on every blog and every social media channel. And you can almost hear the collective sigh over those times we came up short. The Mautic community will probably do the same. But I’m reminded of a song lyric you may have heard before -

> **Every new beginning comes from some other beginning''s end.**
- *Closing Time, Semisonic*

What a great line! I believe that for Mautic this means maybe we should look forward instead of backward. Let’s look at 2018 as a new beginning coming from our 2017’s ending. In fact, we wanted to do something more. We wanted to start 2018’s new beginning now. Confused? Let me see if I can make it a bit more obvious. The Mautic community is going to do some amazing things next year. Incredibly amazing. We have tremendous growth ahead of us and some fantastic initiatives we are going to undertake. In order to achieve everything we want to we are starting our new beginning now.

Whether you want to think of this as an early holiday gift, or just a jumpstart on 2018; make no mistake, what comes next is truly awesome. Today, the Mautic community is announcing a number of exciting improvements. Some are obvious, some are complete and some are just getting started. But all of these things need your input! Allow me to walk you through what’s new.

### 1. Brand New Mautic.org

The first and most obvious update is the [new Mautic.org website](https://www.mautic.org). If you’re here reading then you’ve already seen it, but please let me walk you through it. The Mautic community is truly one of a kind, the biggest open source marketing automation community in the world, and yet our website didn’t focus on our community in any way. We didn’t provide a good home for our volunteers to showcase their talents, share their resources, or find good help. We’ve changed all of that! Here’s what is now available for our incredible Mauticians.

### 2. Mauticians

Did you catch that name drop? We have been unofficially calling our community members “Mauticians” for the last 2 years and yet the name has never been made official. **Today we’re declaring any Mautic volunteer a Mautician**. Any one contributing (in any area) of the Mautic project is now qualified to call themselves a Mautician. We’re excited to be able to clearly define who we are and how we are defined as a community. But the name is just the beginning of this particular new item. Keep reading:

Mautic.org now features a new community portal where our volunteers can show off their achievements, connect with others, build their profiles and so much more. Seriously, if you haven’t already looked around you should go take a peek at [https://www.mautic.org/mauticians](https://www.mautic.org/mauticians)

**Here’s the lowdown**: if you had an account in the Mautic forums before then you already have an account on this new site...but you’ll need to reset your password. *(Yeah, I’m sorry about that, but we like to keep things safe and this just helps to reinforce that the passwords are secure.)* Go ahead and get logged in again and get to setting up your profile!

Oh, and then you’ll want to get involved with others near you, either in person or in area of interest - which means it’s time to look at the next new thing.

### 3. MautiCamps

The Mautic community has an aspect which, from the very beginning, has made us unique. Our community has self-organized into localized groups faster than just about any other community. In order to stay on top of things we quickly implemented an existing Meetup tool that worked great for us in the beginning but we quickly found limitations (*not to mention it was costly*).

Our volunteer community shouldn’t have to use proprietary solutions, spend additional money and take unnecessary steps to build their local community group. Oh, and we wanted a better name (Nothing’s wrong with Mautic Meetups necessarily; we just wanted something special). The solution to all these problems was creating [**MautiCamps**](https://www.mautic.org/mauticamps/).

> A MautiCamp is a community-lead group of Mauticians that meet regularly to discuss all things Mautic-related. They may be geographically relevant, topic specific or even skill based.

Pretty cool right? *A MautiCamp can even be virtual*. Don’t be constrained with physical boundaries. Have a group of Mauticians that want to meet every month around the topic of theme development? **MautiCamp Themes**. Maybe you’re in the Toronto area and want to meet face-to-face with other Mauticians, join **MautiCamp Toronto**. There really are no limitations when it comes to MautiCamps. Interested in learning more? Here’s a [blog post](http://dbhurley.com/re-launching-mautic-meetups/) you should read. [Check out the existing MautiCamps](https://www.mautic.org/mauticamps) to see if there are any you’d like to join. And if you don’t see the right one for your town or your area of interest... jump in and start leading it! The forums will have more information on this topic and would be a great place to get started.

### 4. Mautic Forums

Wow, the new things keep coming and the excitement continues to grow. And I just love how the ending for each previous new feature leads us directly into the next one. The forums we had were good. In fact, I liked them because they were fast and kinda pretty. But they had some issues too. They didn’t sync well with the rest of the site. There was no visibility into how they related to Mauticians. There was a general lack of functionality and things like pagination were missing (*who knew that would feel so nice to have*). Oh, and the search wasn’t so great. I am pleased to share we have rebuilt the forums directly into the website. Everything integrated into one brand-new, beautiful home.

The new [Mautic Community forums](https://www.mautic.org/forums) feature all the things that we were missing before. Now of course as we launch there will be some issues and a few minor glitches (like the user account situation I shared earlier). So, if you haven’t done so, you’ll need to reset your password. But that’s really about the only change you’ll have to make. Your forum posts, comments, replies will now all be available on your [Mautician page](https://www.mautic.org/mauticians/) as well, which is super nice.

So those are the new features of Mautic.org. A complete rebuild from the ground up. A re-focusing on the value of our community and the power of our volunteers. We’re putting the focus where it should be - on the individuals who make up our community.

Oh, but wait, there’s one more thing. I don’t know how I could have forgotten this one:

### 5. Mautic Marketplace

With the launch of the new Mautic.org website we are also unveiling Version 1 of the [**Mautic Marketplace**](https://www.mautic.org/marketplace/). This early iteration will allow you to submit your **Mixin** for inclusion in the Marketplace.

> A **Mixin** is a plugin, integration, theme, workflow or package that can be added to a Mautic instance to add or extend functionality or design in some way.

This Marketplace is an early version. There will be things to improve here as we grow. We knew we needed some way to organize the many amazing tools our community was already creating, even in these beginning days. We’ve added some of the Mixins we''re aware of - if you own one of them please be sure to reach out so we can give you ownership of the Mixin.

The Mautic Marketplace will eventually be available within the Mautic product and you’ll be able to install them incredibly easily. What we are building takes time to do it right, and as with everything in Mautic, we want to build it the right way. Don’t let this stop you. Start contributing your Mixins today. Build your plugins, your integrations, your themes and get your name and company brand out there in front of the hundreds of thousands of Mautic organizations.

*There will be a much more detailed post coming in the future weeks that will share more of the specifics and features of the Mautic Marketplace initiative. Check back on our blog or sign up for our newsletter to stay informed!*

Shoot, did I mention the newsletter? I guess I have to tell you about that too! If you just feel like you don’t have quite enough Mautic in your life then you’ll want to [sign up for **The Mautic Moment**](https://www.mautic.org/get-involved/mailing-lists/). This is our community newsletter (*I''m not going to say how often we’re sending - for now we’re going to just say ‘infrequently’*). Interested in writing for The Mautic Moment? It’s a community newsletter so you’re encouraged to get involved!

Okay, so just to recap:


 	2. We’ve launched a new Mautic.org website...
 	4. Our community members are called Mauticians...
 	6. We rebuilt our community meetups into MautiCamps...
 	8. The Mautic forums are new, improved and integrated...
 	10. We’ve launched the first version of the Mautic Marketplace...
 	12. And we have a newsletter, The Mautic Moment to stay in the know.


And now I really need to end this post. Or should I say, I need to go prepare the beginning for the next one. Join me in celebrating these many new features that we’re beginning. Mautic isn’t ending 2017; instead Mautic is starting 2018 a little bit early. With this many fantastic new initiatives for you to get involved in I encourage you to get started. Go out and get involved. I’ll leave you with one more lyric from the start of the song I shared the ending from earlier.

> **Time for you to go out go out into the world.**

I’ve been in and around technology for nearly 20 years. Everything from IT administration/end-user support, software development and technology marketing/sales. In each one of these lines of work, there has been a consistent theme. Testing. 


### Why Testing?


If we’re honest, all end user support starts with a lot of questions. What was happening when that issue happened? Were you doing another task when that happened? What led up to the error? What showed up on screen when it happened? These questions are all designed to provide answers that lead to preventing that issue in the future. 

Every operating system, mobile application or other software that we may use, operates in an environment that is unique to it. Trying to determine the source of these issues, often means understanding the environment as well as every unique element related to it. Once a possible source is discovered, we test to determine if our hypothesis is correct. 

In a similar fashion, whether you are designing digital learning tools, or a robust marketing automation solution, each newly designed feature or added capability requires testing to ensure that it operates in a manner befitting its goal. And likewise with marketing messages, there are companies that primarily work on focus group testing messages with a variety of audiences to ensure that their message is resonating with it’s potential customers. 

If we can find testing in so many environments, then it makes logical sense that we equip our own organizations with systems that provide us with the opportunity to test out new software that will impact our business. That’s why we are excited to share that we will be re-launching a beta-release program with the announcement of Mautic 2.9.0!


### Beta-Release


For those who don''t adhere to a [release management process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_management), in its simplest form there is a test server and a production server. Each of these have their own purpose. The test server provides organizations with the ability to load and test pre-releases of software in an environment that doesn''t interrupt your day-to-day marketing automation (or other business) activities. The production server typically contains the most stable version of the software that enables you to continue gathering data on your audience as well as provide them with value at every interaction.

Mautic makes it simple to access and test beta-releases. To set up a test server, follow a similar process for a production server, with the most significant change occurring in the setup of Mautic. Follow the link below for more configuration details.


> **IMPORTANT NOTE:** Please do not use beta releases in your production environment. There may be bugs still present in a beta release. Remember to always take a backup of your files and database prior to applying any updates, beta or otherwise.

For those who don''t adhere to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Release_management">release management process</a>, in its simplest form there is a test server and a production server. Each of these have their own purpose. The test server provides organizations with the ability to load and test pre-releases of software in an environment that doesn''t interrupt your day-to-day marketing automation (or other business) activities. The production server typically contains the most stable version of the software that enables you to continue gathering data on your audience as well as provide them with value at every interaction.

Mautic makes it simple to access and test beta-releases. To set up a test server, follow a similar process for a production server, with the most significant change occurring in the setup of Mautic. Follow the link below for more configuration details.

<blockquote><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Please do not use beta releases in your production environment. There may be bugs still present in a beta release. Remember to always take a backup of your files and database prior to applying any updates, beta or otherwise.</blockquote>

Since the very beginning, Mautic set out on a journey to change the way businesses communicate with their audiences. It began with simplicity. The design of Mautic was intended to be effortless and simple in its functionality. We also set out to connect with audiences through a variety of channels, not just email. Maybe more importantly than functional simplicity, and channel diversity was integrating marketing communications throughout the entire customer journey. That meant integrating with other systems in the marketing stack. Whether home-grown or off-the-shelf, legacy or modern, our open API seeks to bring that complete vision to life.

We’re excited to share that there has been a number of improvements to existing integrations and features, as well as new features and integrations that have been added in the 2.9.0 release of Mautic.   


### Integrations:



##### Systems Connectivity:



- **Zapier:** A new integration with Zapier has been created which is available through the Zapier interface. This integration allows a you to create workflows in Zapier based on data from Mautic. These workflows can be triggered based on form submission data, email open data, page hit data, point change data and contact creation or updated data. So many opportunities to provide information across your organization, making each customer experience more relevant and valuable.

- **Connectwise:** Similarly, a bi-directional sync with Connectwise is now available as a standard plugin. Leads can be created in Connectwise from form or campaign actions in Mautic. Data from Connectwise can be brought back to the contact and company records in Mautic. There is also a full sync option available where any changes made or new contacts created in Mautic can be pushed to Connectwise on a periodic basis.



##### CRM:



- **CRM Integrations:** With this release we are announcing a number of standard CRM plugins to Mautic. With each one of these plugins, a bi-directional sync is standard. Leads can be created in each of these CRM’s from form or campaign actions in Mautic. Data from the CRM’s can be brought back to the contact and company records in Mautic as well. There is also a full sync option available where any changes made in Mautic can be pushed to the CRM’s on a periodic basis. *(NOTE: Although each plugin exhibits similar functionality, each will require unique configuration, so be on the lookout for further instruction.) * These CRM’s include:


   - SugarCRM (v6.x and v7.x will be supported.)
   - Zoho
   - MS Dynamics
   - PipeDrive



**

2. Salesforce optimization:** Along with these standard CRM plugins, the Salesforce plugin has been refactored for performance improvements and scalability. We have also fixed the issue where boolean fields did not sync properly in some cases.



In addition to the exciting integration updates, there has also been work done on one of the most powerful aspects of Mautic, reporting. We all recognize that the ability to review the information that is being gathered is critical to the success of any given effort. These new filters and bug fixes will equip you with better data, making engagement with your audiences more effective.


### 
Reporting



- **Reporting filters:** You can now specify And/Or conditions at the same level between multiple filters on a report. Additional operators have also been added - these include: 


   - contains (e.g you can have a filter of last name contains "lbe" to pull in all contacts that match %lbe%)
   - starts with (e.g. you can have a filter of last name starts with "Gil" to pull in all contacts that match Gil%)
   - ends with (e.g. you can have a filter of last name ends with "bert" to pull in all contacts that match %bert)



- **Device filters:** You can now create segments based on what device type, brand, OS and model the contact has accessed a marketing communication from. 

- **Metric alignment:** A number of issues regarding report inconsistencies in different areas of the product specifically around emails have been resolved.




### Functionality



- **Focus Items Formatting:** You can now format the content for focus items! A new section called ‘content’ has been added to the builder for focus items that enables you to format content in basic, editor or html mode. This opens the door for even more creativity when engaging visitors to your site.




### Infrastructure And Performance



- **List upload speed improvement:** The list upload speed has been significantly improved. Lists now take ⅙ of the time they did before this enhancement - meaning, if a file took 60 seconds to upload it now takes 10! From a UI perspective, for fields with more than 1000 records, the import process will now run in the background and notify you when complete. It will automatically switch to this background process for files that have over 1000 records so that you are free to leave the page and work in other areas of Mautic. Now there''s even more time to accomplish what you set out to do. 



We’re grateful for the those of you who made the effort to load the beta release of 2.9.0 and test the variety of features, functionality and fixes that were part of this release. Mautic would not be where it is today without the incredible community that we have.

We love finding and featuring amazing community members who are doing incredible things for Mautic.  

   


#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

I have been into web development, digital marketing and graphic design for 15 years, when I started my own creative studio I always researched different systems to utilise for clients and make business easier for all. My main focus has always been helping start-ups get off the ground digitally and with their marketing/literature. Eventually after years I stumbled upon Mautic via Softaculous, started using it, have praised it since and have seen how it has evolved massively.


#### What is one word that describes you?

That’s a hard one, I’d say...insistent.


#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic and what is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

When I started using Mautic I had so many ideas on ways to expand the system for CRM use, task management and for client use. Once I found the Mautic Slack community I was able to speak to many of the contributors and the people that basically helped me lay a foundation for all the start-up businesses I’ve worked with over the years; so as much as I wanted to expand Mautic there is no place better to do so than the slack community by contributing.

The best part of the community is how open and fast it is to learn from many different people, great place to converse and good networking.


#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

“Daddy, you’re a superhero.” — my son Isaac :)


#### What is your BAG (big, audacious goal) in life?

My BHAG is to continuously build and adapt a community that is suitable for all people and company sizes to utilise and aid their business in all digital aspects. Most people stumble upon “new tech/software” they could use from different sites but do not have the support to help them grow in its use or purpose. I’m in the process of this by building a company called Your Digital Club.


#### What do you enjoy doing when you’re not working?

I’m a family man so when I’m not working I’m spending time with my wife and son, the latest craze with my son is pirates and making me “walk the plank” with his form sword in hand.


#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

I’ve watched all the twilight movies (not by choice :( ) lol


### Dear Andre,

The Mautic community would like to recognize your incredible dedication and support, and offer a huge, heartfelt, thank you!

*We''re excited to continue sharing content developed by the Mautic community. This post was written by Jurian Janssen.*

Have you ever wondered if you could track more than just visits via the Mautic tracking script? I know I did, and in this article I will show you how we can use URL’s to track anything you want.


#### The Basics


Before we start let’s have a look at these two URL examples. This one is without extra parameter:


```
https://mydomain.com/page/test/
```


And here we have the same URL with an extra parameter:


```
https://mydomain.com/page/test/?email=johndoe@company.com
```


If you use for example MailChimp or CampaignMonitor to send out marketing emails, consider using this technique. Simply add the email address as a parameter at the end of the URL.

In php one can catch this parameter simply with a:


```
$email = $_GET[‘email’];
```


And then proceed to use that parameter for processing. However, there is also a clever way of using the Mautic Javascript to track visitors on your site. Only some slight modifications can make it send off any lead field you want to Mautic.


#### Get Tracking with Mautic


Here is the default script:


```
<script>
    (function(w,d,t,u,n,a,m){w[''MauticTrackingObject'']=n;
        w[n]=w[n]||function(){(w[n].q=w[n].q||[]).push(arguments)},a=d.createElement(t),
        m=d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];a.async=1;a.src=u;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    })(window,document,''script'',''https://mydomain.com/mtc.js'',''mt'');

    mt(''send'', ''pageview'');
</script>
```


In short, what this does is simply pass along the identification parameters such as IP address and device fingerprint, together with the page the user is visiting. Now have a look at the script below.


```
<script>
	function getUrlParameter(name) {
		name = name.replace(/[\\[]/, ''\\\\['').replace(/[\\]]/, ''\\\\]'');
		var regex = new RegExp(''[\\\\?&]'' + name + ''=([^^&#]*)'');
		var results = regex.exec(location.search);
		return results === null ? '''' : decodeURIComponent(results[1].replace(/\\+/g, '' ''));
	};
	
    (function(w,d,t,u,n,a,m){w[''MauticTrackingObject'']=n;
        w[n]=w[n]||function(){(w[n].q=w[n].q||[]).push(arguments)},a=d.createElement(t),
        m=d.getElementsByTagName(t)[0];a.async=1;a.src=u;m.parentNode.insertBefore(a,m)
    })(window,document,''script'',''https://domain.com/mtc.js'',''mt'');

	var email  = getUrlParameter(''e'');

	if(email !== ''''){
		mt(''send'', ''pageview'', {email: email});
	} else {
		mt(''send'', ''pageview'');
	}
</script>
```


The first function is used to extract a custom parameter from the URL. You can use this function for any parameter you want. Just make sure to pass the correct name to the function. In our case the name is ‘email’.

Below that you can see the default part of the Mautic tracking script. This is not relevant for us. It does what it needs to do, no need to concern us with that for now. Below that you will see a new variable is created with the name ‘email’ and the value it will get is the URL parameter for ‘email’. This means that this variable will hold the content of the URL that comes after ‘?email=’, which should be the email address of the user.

Then we have a short if-statement. This statement simply checks if the email parameter is filled or not. If it is not (which is the case for people that visit your website without a newsletter link) it will simply pass along the usual parameters. But if the email parameter is present it will pass along the usual parameters together with the email address.


#### Sending a Custom Parameter

You can send this along by adding ‘{email: email}’ to the mt method. Keep in mind that the first string identifies the field you want to pass along. In this case we want to pass along the email, but this could also be any other field like firstname or lastname, or even a custom field you have created. The second string or value is the actual value that needs to be passed along. Since we put the value we got from the URL in the ‘email’ parameter we just write ‘email’ to indicated that we want to pass along the string inside this value.

Lastly, make sure you enable public updating for the fields you want to track using this method. If public updating is not enabled Mautic will simply drop the field. You can do this by going to the ‘Custom fields’ section, then selecting the field you want and changing ‘publicly updatable’ from ‘no’ to ‘yes’.

Congratulations! You can now track custom parameters on your website!


#### The Possibilities Are Endless


Using the Mautic tracking script this way opens up new ways to identify your contacts. Think about the contact points you have and how you can use them to track different data sets.

If you are using mailing tools like Mailchimp or CampaignMonitor it is super easy to add the add extra parameters to your newsletters. Simply append the extra parameter to all the URL’s in your mail and there you go! In fact, you can use any contact network on point you have and use this methods for the parameters at hand.


#### Security


We should not forget that we are still handing personal data here. If you are appending sensitive data to a URL make sure you think about handling the data safely. What you could do is hash the parameters and de-hash them in your website before you send them off to Mautic. This way anyone who might come across the link cannot read or use the parameters.

Also make sure to use https, also known as SSL if possible. This is simply an extra layer of security added to the request the user will make. Best practice is to use both SSL for your website as well as the connection between your website and Mautic. You will see in the examples above the I have used https in the code, and not http.

And there you go. Now you know how to track custom parameters with the Mautic tracking script. I cannot wait to see what creative ways you all come up with to use this!

	} else {

	}
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

The first function is used to extract a custom parameter from the URL. You can use this function for any parameter you want. Just make sure to pass the correct name to the function. In our case the name is ‘email’.

Below that you can see the default part of the Mautic tracking script. This is not relevant for us. It does what it needs to do, no need to concern us with that for now. Below that you will see a new variable is created with the name ‘email’ and the value it will get is the URL parameter for ‘email’. This means that this variable will hold the content of the URL that comes after ‘?email=’, which should be the email address of the user.

Then we have a short if-statement. This statement simply checks if the email parameter is filled or not. If it is not (which is the case for people that visit your website without a newsletter link) it will simply pass along the usual parameters. But if the email parameter is present it will pass along the usual parameters together with the email address.

<h4>Sending a Custom Parameter</h4>
You can send this along by adding ‘{email: email}’ to the mt method. Keep in mind that the first string identifies the field you want to pass along. In this case we want to pass along the email, but this could also be any other field like firstname or lastname, or even a custom field you have created. The second string or value is the actual value that needs to be passed along. Since we put the value we got from the URL in the ‘email’ parameter we just write ‘email’ to indicated that we want to pass along the string inside this value.

Lastly, make sure you enable public updating for the fields you want to track using this method. If public updating is not enabled Mautic will simply drop the field. You can do this by going to the ‘Custom fields’ section, then selecting the field you want and changing ‘publicly updatable’ from ‘no’ to ‘yes’.

Congratulations! You can now track custom parameters on your website!

<h4>The Possibilities Are Endless</h4>

Using the Mautic tracking script this way opens up new ways to identify your contacts. Think about the contact points you have and how you can use them to track different data sets.

If you are using mailing tools like Mailchimp or CampaignMonitor it is super easy to add the add extra parameters to your newsletters. Simply append the extra parameter to all the URL’s in your mail and there you go! In fact, you can use any contact network on point you have and use this methods for the parameters at hand.

<h4>Security</h4>

We should not forget that we are still handing personal data here. If you are appending sensitive data to a URL make sure you think about handling the data safely. What you could do is hash the parameters and de-hash them in your website before you send them off to Mautic. This way anyone who might come across the link cannot read or use the parameters.

Also make sure to use https, also known as SSL if possible. This is simply an extra layer of security added to the request the user will make. Best practice is to use both SSL for your website as well as the connection between your website and Mautic. You will see in the examples above the I have used https in the code, and not http.

And there you go. Now you know how to track custom parameters with the Mautic tracking script. I cannot wait to see what creative ways you all come up with to use this!

Let’s be honest. Process handoffs within your business require real focus and attention. These handoffs happen from marketing to sales, sales to services, services to accounting and everywhere in between. The moment your marketing message reaches a potential customer, the expectations begin. Every interaction that you have from discovery through purchase and beyond, can make or break their experience. It’s critical that your business mirror that message throughout every connection, whether in person or online.

In the latest release of Mautic we’ve placed some focus on campaign functionality and the API. Your online brand experience has hundreds, likely thousands of handoffs being made each and every day. Information that is passed through campaign actions and shared through API’s is vital to engaging your audience in a meaningful customer journey. From critical notifications to releasing information at specific times and so much more, all of these elements ensure that your customers are feeling supported at each step.

To support you in maintaining these vital connections, here are the highlights of Mautic 2.10.0;


### Campaign functionality



- **Company fields update via import and forms:** You can now update fields on the company entity via forms and through imports. A new import button has been added to the company page. In addition, a new section called “Company fields” is available to map contact imports to. Similarly when adding a form field to a form, new company fields are available to map to. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4604))

- **New Webhook campaign action:** A new action has been added “send a webhook”. This enables you to send specified information to a specified URL as part of a campaign. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4357))

- **Custom timeframe campaign condition:** A new date function has been added where you can specify as part of a campaign condition, a custom number of days/weeks/month before or after a date associated with a custom field.([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4566))

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/81206C97-173C-4BA7-B8AE-925A904141C0-1024x928.jpeg)


- **Timestamp updates on contact field through a campaign:** You can now update a timestamp field on the contact through a campaign using custom functions such as NOW, TODAY, YESTERDAY and TOMORROW. There is also a NULL function that is now available which when added as a contact field update as part of a campaign will clear out the existing value in the specified field for the contact. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4615))

- **Internal notifications as part of campaign:** A new action has been added to campaigns  - ‘send email to user’ will allow an email notification to be sent to a user, contact''s owner or any To, Cc, Bcc email addresses as a campaign action. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4458))

- Additional Campaign actions to; 


- **Post to Facebook and Google Analytics:** There is a new setting added in the configuration section under Tracking Settings. You can add your Facebook pixel ID or your GA id. Using this, information about a contact can be sent as part of a campaign when a contact visits a landing page so that this can be used for Facebook or GA paid campaigns to better filter data and generate target audiences. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4573))

- **Show Focus Items:** A new action has been added to a campaign after the page visit decision - to show a focus item. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4666))






### API and Integration Improvements



- **API improvements -** A number of significant improvements have been made to the API to enable data around contact activities to be more easily accessible. The following new data points are now available:


- All events table: ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4548))
- Form submission data: ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4613))
- Webinar data from Citrix: ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4419))



- **Bi-directional updates for Null values for all CRM integrations:** Mautic now supports the ability to bi-directionally sync data where there are NULL values in fields, irrespective of the specified direction of sync. This means, if there is a blank value in a field that has been mapped as part of the plugin, if the value is missing in either system, it will be updated even if the system that has the value is not the system of record for this field. This has been created for the following CRM integrations - Salesforce, Hubspot, ConnectWise, Zoho, MSDynamics, SugarCRM. The feature is configurable by the user. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4445))

- **Keeping unsubscribes in sync:** Unsubscribe information from supported CRM systems is now available to map as part of configuring the plugin. This is done so that subscription statuses can be kept in sync between CRM systems and Mautic. This is available for the following CRMs - Salesforce, Hubspot, ConnectWise, Zoho, MSDynamics, SugarCRM. ([Github link](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4459))




### UI/UX Improvements



- **Audit log and integration tabs added to contact for additional visibility:** Two new tabs are available on the contact page to provide you with better visibility into updates made to the contact - Integrations and Audit log. ([Github link 1](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4457) and [link 2](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4426))

- **Clickable stats on emails, contacts card view:** The stats labels on the email record are now clickable, enabling you to easily navigate to the list of underlying contacts. (Stats will show total metrics whereas the underlying list will show unique contacts - which means the numbers may not match.) Also, a list of contacts that have been sent the email will now be visible in a new tab called ‘contacts’ on the email detail page. ([Github link 1](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4576) and [link 2](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/pull/4637))

- **Apply buttons added to landing page, email, campaign builder:** The Mautic builder continues to improve. Now applying changes to any of these elements is made easier with the addition of the Apply button. This enables you to save your changes before closing it.

*We''re excited to continue sharing content developed by the Mautic community. This solution and post was developed and written by Joan Nin (Slack: @ninjoan).*

Are you looking for ways to make a backup of your Mautic instance fast, easy and automatic? This tutorial will give you the ability to backup your Mautic database to your Dropbox account.

You will need the following:


2. Dropbox account
4. Backup script
6. Cron job
8. Basic knowledge of the command line (PC) or terminal (Mac)




### Step 1: Dropbox Account


Sign-in or create a brand new account with Dropbox then go to [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) on your web browser, and create a new Dropbox app. Fill in the information of the new app as shown below, and enter the app name use a name that will be easy to you to remember in case you have more apps.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/UGC-Post-Backups-2-1024x959.jpg)


After you have created a new app, you will redirect to new windows and you will see a button with the text Generated access token click and copy the access token.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/UGC-Post-Backups-3-1003x1024.jpg)



### Step 2: Backup Script


The script we going to use is made by [Andrea Fabrizi](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) kudos to this guy. To use Dropbox backup script, [download](https://github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader) the script and make it executable.


```
wget https://raw.github.com/andreafabrizi/Dropbox-Uploader/master/dropbox_uploader.sh
chmod +x dropbox_uploader.sh
```


Then run the following command;

```
./dropbox_uploder.sh
```


Next it will ask you to insert the generated access token. Insert the provided token and confirm. To verify that you have established the connection with Dropbox, run the following command;


```
./dropbox_uploder.sh info
```


Doing so should display your Dropbox Information;


```
Dropbox Uploader v1.0
> Getting info... 
Name:		Joan Nin
UID:		dbid:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
Email:		your-email
Country:	DO
```


Now let''s create a shell script that will make the import of our database.

Create a new directory db-backup and a .sh file.


```
cd
mkdir db-backup
nano  dbdump.sh
```


And copy and paste this info to the dbdump.sh file you create.


```
#!/bin/bash
sudo mysqldump -uMYSQLUSER -pMYSQLDATABASE-PASSWORD DATABASENAME > 
/root/db-backup/mautic.sql
## THIS LINE UPLOADS THE MAUTIC.SQL FILE TO THE DROPBOX DIRECTORY BACKUP-Mautic
./dropbox_uploader.sh upload /root/db-backup/mautic.sql /BACKUP-Mautic
## Removed THIS WILL REMOVE THE MAUTIC.SQL FROM YOUR SERVER
rm -r /root/db-backup/mautic.sql
#END
```


**NOTE:** Replace the italics text with your information.
*MYSQLUSER* = sql user
*MYSQLDATABASE-PASSWORD* = SQL Password
*DATABASENAME* = the name of the database you use in Mautic


### Step 3: Cron Job


Now create a cron job that will automate this task for you. Using the crontab from your server create the following line;


```
### MAUTIC BACKUP
27 3 */15 * * echo "`date -u` `/root/db-backup/dbdump.sh`" >> /root/db-backup/status.log 2>&1
```


This line will run the backup “At 03:27 on every 15th day-of-month.” you can replace the with the time you prefer. Also this will create a log file with the date that the cron job will run. I think this is a pretty neat option for backup/audit.

And that''s it. A simple, yet effective way to backup your Mautic instance.

<strong>NOTE:</strong> Replace the italics text with your information.
<em>MYSQLUSER</em> = sql user
<em>MYSQLDATABASE-PASSWORD</em> = SQL Password
<em>DATABASENAME</em> = the name of the database you use in Mautic

<h3>Step 3: Cron Job</h3>

Now create a cron job that will automate this task for you. Using the crontab from your server create the following line;

<pre>### MAUTIC BACKUP
27 3 */15 * * echo "`date -u` `/root/db-backup/dbdump.sh`" >> /root/db-backup/status.log 2>&1</pre>

This line will run the backup “At 03:27 on every 15th day-of-month.” you can replace the with the time you prefer. Also this will create a log file with the date that the cron job will run. I think this is a pretty neat option for backup/audit.

And that''s it. A simple, yet effective way to backup your Mautic instance.

*We''re excited to continue sharing content developed by the Mautic community. This post on tags was written by Andre Etienne.*

Within the amount of time I’ve been in the Mautic community, I have often seen many questions about best practice for tags; there is no best practice set in stone, you find what works for you in your data structure and test through trial and error if the end-point is functional in the way you require.

For example, a project I currently work on deals with apprenticeships and distance learning courses. When I started this project they segmented their mailing list in 2 different ways:

The first being;


- Professional
- Funded/Apprenticeship
- Employers


And the second;


- Accounting
- Leadership & Management
- Funded/Apprenticeships
- Employers


I setup Mautic and altered the segment structure to look like this;


- Professional (Professional mailing list)
- Accounting (Professional mailing list)
- Leadership & Management (Professional mailing list)
- Funded/Apprenticeships (Funded mailing list)
- Employers (Employer mailing list)




### Workflow Using Tags:


This is great when wanting to manually send/schedule broadcast emails, but essentially doesn’t help when you want to use one workflow to manage/send emails to the entire list based on conditions; I’m currently in the process of building a mailing list workflow for the first half of 2018 that will send out emails to the entire mailing list based on tag conditions.

1. Starting with “contact segments” as the source I select all mailing list segments.
 
![tags01](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Point-01-copy-1024x480.jpg)


2. This is where tags come into play, there is no need to create hundreds of segments to cater to each sector within a specific mailing list so instead I use tags. First, I add a condition to check the segment then I add another condition to specify the tag to check next.

![tags02](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Point-02-copy-1024x479.jpg)


3. The accounting list segments further into areas such as starting an accounting career, promotion/career advancement, bookkeeping, self-employment. I am using tags to prescript the subjects of the email for that segment within that period.

![tags03](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Point-03-copy-1024x480.jpg)


4. I then create two emails, one for bookkeeping and one for all others. Having the knowledge that users on the mailing list are very specific about what they’re interested in helps us select the focal subject and then generalize all other areas.

![tags04](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Point-04-copy-1024x480.jpg)


5. Then it’s just a case of repeating the tag condition for each sector and subject within that segment, then moving on to the next mailing list.

![tags05](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Point-05-copy-1024x506.jpg)


For me this is an optimum way to break down and schedule emails for our mailing list while deciding the subject each monthly email within a list sector (accounting, leadership & management); we also manage to cater to other users on the mailing list that are not interested in that appointed subject.

Working on a 6-month basis you can clone the campaign and at the end of the flow move users to the new campaign that handles the second half of the year.

How often do we discover challenges in our organizations? If we''re being honest, all organizations deal with challenges each and every day. What is our reaction? Do we take steps to truly discover the underlying issues, or are we quick to take broad sweeping actions to course correct? 

Many times we see knee-jerk reactions in an effort to solve situations that simply require reflection, time and precision. Consider our marketing. We all want to gather greater levels of information and foster deeper connections with our audience. So we do more, add more, give more. We certainly mean well. But if our desire is to develop more meaningful relationships with our customers, should we?

“If you look at everything Apple does, it’s constantly reducing the steps. Steve Jobs used to say technology can either be beautiful – and he was a fanatic about making products that could be as beautiful as possible – or technology should be invisible, which means simplifying.”  - John Scully, Former CEO, Apple


At Mautic, we are always seeking to simplify the complex. Your customer should not see clunky steps and processes as engagement, those should be largely invisible. We’re constantly evaluating each feature and finding ways to eliminate steps as you develop your communication. Our goal is to help you create simple, seamless interactions with your audience. To help you accomplish this, here are just a few of the updates in the latest release of Mautic;


### Enhancements:



- **Update Contact Owner:** The relationship an organization has with it’s customers is vital. That’s why when there are multiple owners, it’s important to adjust ownership throughout the customer journey. Now, users can update contact owner as part of a campaign so they can assign these to different reps to own the relationship with that contact. This is accomplished by a new campaign action called: “Update contact owner”. 

- **Merged Contact Tracking:** Don''t use Mautic forms? No problem. Now you can merge activity for unknown contacts by passing the mtc_id cookie value to Mautic when using a non-Mautic form. This feature merges activity for unknown contacts that become known contacts and enables all activity to be tracked on the same contact.

- **Customize Preference Center:** Users now have the ability to build a custom preference center page that can be referenced as part of an email. Admin users have access to create this page from the landing page area and mark this as a preference center page. A new section has been added in the permission area to manage access to this page. *(*The [Channel Frequency](https://mautic.com/help/manage-subscriptions/) feature must be used.)* 

- **Internal Notifications Using Forms:** Information sharing in your business is critical to keeping the customer journey moving. That’s why Mautic now allows you to trigger emails to internal team members when a contact timeline event is recorded through a standalone form. 

- **Campaign Previews:** We''ve added a "preview" tab to the details view in the Campaign Builder. The preview will update in real time during any campaign builder update, however, modification to the campaign assets cannot happen from the preview. 

- **Dynamic Content For Visitors:** Dynamic content continues to be an important part of user engagement. Now you can show dynamic content to anonymous visitors based on their IP to improve the conversion of unknown visitors to known contacts.  This can be done for anyone coming to a Mautic or non-Mautic landing page. New filters have been added to the dynamic content creation area to enable this. Dynamic content can also be shown to known contacts based on segment membership. 

- **Files in Forms:** Want to include document uploads in your Mautic form? Done. Contacts now have the ability to upload attachments/files as part of forms and store these in Mautic.

- **Frequency Rules:** Visibility into which communications have been delayed by frequency rules has arrived. See which communications are delayed due to a contact hitting a frequency rule. You also have access to cancel or reschedule the email directly from the contact timeline.




### Integrations



- **Filter Activities to Push to Salesforce:**  You can now configure which events from Mautic get written to the custom activity object in Salesforce. The benefit of writing the data to Salesforce is; 1. Visibility for the sales rep to marketing activities responded to by the contact and 2. The ability to create reports and dashboards in Salesforce to report on marketing activities. 

- **Improvements to Connectwise:**  You can now generate a task in Connectwise based on a campaign action in Mautic. You can also bring marketing groups from Connectwise into Mautic to create segments in Mautic.

They mean that we will be able to reach more people, accomplish more tasks, and grow our business. But if we’re being realistic, some of these tools are not fully active in our businesses today. Research states:


> “85% of marketers who use automation tools believe they don’t use them to their full potential.” ([Source](https://www.emailmonday.com/marketing-automation-statistics-overview))


This means that we likely have systems in our business that are helping us achieve specific goals, but not to the degree that leverages their full capability. 

Not only are we not using these systems to their full potential, some of these new technologies have not been fully developed. So how do we navigate this digital marketing maze? How do we find our way while leveraging these powerful tools to make more meaningful connections with our customers? The future of digital marketing is being shaped by a variety of tools and capabilities. They will promise a great many things, but preparing for them is just as critical as implementing them.

Here are a few key things to remember when moving forward through the space between existing and future technology:

------


#### People are still needed:

Our desire to bring value to customers should never be replaced by a computer. Computers still can’t interpret the innate needs of our customers. Although we are gathering terabytes of data, we need people to help interpret the data in a way that makes meaning.  



> “But what needs to go is our reliance on using automation to do our jobs. Because at the end of the day, we’re communicators.” ([Source](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/284821#))

What this means is that we need to get smarter about how we use digital marketing systems in our business. Where does it make sense to automate? When do your customers value the human element? When do they simply want information? As marketers, our job is to truly understand the journey and the value at each and every touch-point.  




#### Focus on workflow:

One of the most damaging things that any business can do when preparing for new technology is to create rigid, inflexible workflows. As technology continues to develop and add new features, workflows along your customer journey should remain flexible.
  

We often assume our customer journey’s work in one direction. Rarely do we consider a customer going backward. This thinking limits the view of our processes and workflow. We become rigid in our thinking, making it difficult when new technologies come into view. We should consider our marketing as operating in multiple directions, often skipping steps or moving from one touch-point to another without warning.  


Not only will this approach help you be innovative in the way you engage customers, it will provide the flexibility required to add/remove process steps to improve the way you engage everyone along the journey.  




#### Prepare your stack:

Most everyone is familiar with the term “agile”. We use this term when describing software development, manufacturing, construction and even marketing. At its core agile;  



> “...advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development...and continuous improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.” ([Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development))

These principles are important to running any business. They should be adaptive, innovative, flexible and continuously improve. If this is true, then your marketing stack should reflect the same. The key is to keep every area of your marketing stack flexible in the way that it communicates with customers, associates, and other systems. This will allow you to respond to the demands of new technology before it arrives in your business.  



Digital marketing is constantly changing. As customers continue adopting new technologies and changing their buying habits, our businesses need to be quick to respond. This requires flexibility, not rigid workflows and systems that restrict.

Marketing stack. If you’ve been in marketing technology circles long enough, you’ve heard this term. It refers to all the technologies that your business utilizes to reach and engage your customers. Which by all accounts continues to grow. There are over 5,000 solutions that fall into the marketing technology ecosystem. So many, that to look at [chiefmartec’s MarTech 5000 infographic](https://martechtoday.com/infographic-marketing-technology-landscape-113956), would make one lose their balance.

This poses a serious challenge for us in the marketing space. And it’s being realized across the entire industry.

> “A Q1 ‘17 survey by [CMO Council](https://www.cmocouncil.org/) and [Redpoint Global](https://www.redpointglobal.com/) revealed only 3% of respondents felt all of their automation, engagement and deployment tools were fully connected, with data, metrics and insights traveling freely between different technologies.” ([Source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/11/organizing-your-marketing-tech-stack/))

It’s an alarming statistic, but not surprising. With so many solutions, there is an incredible opportunity to be more thoughtful in our approach to the design, organization, and management of our marketing stack. Let’s look at a few realities that will move us from not-so-managed to managed-magic.
**Open Strategy:** What does your marketing technology strategy look like? Is it focused on doing whatever is necessary to delight the customer? Or is it limited by what your technology allows it to do? If your strategy is not open to allow you to take unique and innovative approaches to connecting with your customer, then you should reconsider your approach.  


**Narrow Focus:** With over 5,000 technology solutions it can feel like a daunting task to take an open strategy then narrow your focus. But this focus is not where you think it might be. The focus should be on your customers and associates. Clearly defining your marketing strategy with an open architecture, will allow your teams to take ownership of their place in the customer journey. This enables them to be hyper-focused on improving their processes and workflows and bringing value at each stage.  


**Manage Many:** Regardless of the size of your business, effectively managing multiple technologies can warrant additional time and/or resources. With literally thousands of technologies to help organizations execute on their marketing strategy, it will require proper management to effectively deliver your brand message and promise.  


Every business is at a different stage of marketing stack development. Some have had solutions for years and are currently reviewing how each improves their customer journey. Others are flexible enough to make changes to their stack to prepare it for the future of open marketing. Organizations that are successful will be able to address each of these realities in a way that meets the needs of the business and creates a meaningful brand experience.

Recently, [Mautic](http://www.mautic.com/) announced the addition of [Maestro](http://www.mautic.com/products/maestro-marketing-management/). It offers powerful reporting capabilities, gives users more visibility into the success of initiatives across their entire business in a single dashboard. Companies can freely clone campaigns from other internal teams, and agencies can see a rolled-up view of campaign performance across all their clients. Regardless of your business, a holistic view of this data makes all teams and marketing initiatives more effective.

Working with both self-hosted and Mautic Cloud accounts, Maestro enables all Mautic users to clone campaigns across all their Mautic accounts. It also provides a single, unified view of all your campaign metrics, giving users the ability to understand marketing’s full impact on the business.

The influx of data within our organizations continues to rise. We are tracking every click, every open, every visit. Marketing automation solutions are taking these tasks to a whole new level. More channels of communication and greater levels of depth in our campaigns provide us with even more insight into the thoughts and behaviors of our target audience. 

[We’ve discussed](https://www.mautic.org/blog/marketer/humanize-your-marketing-automation-with-these-7-strategies/) the need to build better stories around our automation before. Not only does our data need to tell a compelling story, but the processes and workflow that we use should support it as well.

Mautic 2.12.0 has added features and enhancements in the area of Reporting and Filters (as well as few bonus items) that should assist your business in that effort. Effectively gathering the right data, at the right time, for the right story is an essential part of getting the most out of your marketing automation strategy. Here''s what we''ve added:


### Reporting and Filters:



- **Scheduled Reports:** Mautic users can now schedule reports to run and send those reports to specified email addresses when the reports are generated. This provides better reporting visibility to both Mautic and non-Mautic users.
- **Segment Reporting:** Users can now report on current segment membership so better tracking of marketing activities is achieved. This tracking is connected to the adding or removing of a contact from a segment.
- **Contacts Manually Added to Segment Visibility:** Now users can see which contacts were added manually, or through a filter, via a new Segment details page.
- **Clickable Stats:** A user can now click stat labels to view a list of contacts that are included in that metric for web/mobile push notifications and SMS in addition to emails.
- **Email Replies:** Users will be able to execute campaign actions based on a contact replying to an email sent through a campaign. (Note: Mautic can only monitor a single imap folder and the contact must reply with the body intact in order to know what to attribute the reply to.)
- **Contact Companies:** Now users will be able to include companies in contact related data sources for reports.




### Integrations:



- **Improvements to Connectwise:** Users can now generate a task in Connectwise based on a campaign action in Mautic. You can also bring marketing groups from Connectwise into Mautic to create segments in Mautic. 




### Other Updates:



- **Themes Update:** We’ve added 4 new landing page themes and 4 new email themes! Not only that, but we’ve added a viewport meta tag on all legacy themes to ensure responsiveness to screen-width.
- **Twitter:** Now users can merge Twitter contacts by matching name.



Growth requires a dedicated process that is powered by relevant information that can steer our strategies in the right direction. We are excited to continue growing Mautic into a solution that will help your business be better equipped to gather and interpret your data. 

A huge thank you to those in the community who made the effort to load the beta release of 2.12.0 and test these features, functionality, and fixes that were part of this release.

INSERT INTO mtorg_db.rainlab_blog_posts (id, user_id, title, slug, excerpt, content, content_html, published_at, published, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (102085, 0, 'Recognizing Mautic Code Contributors', 'recognizing-mautic-code-contributors', '', '![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/light-sign-typography-lighting-1024x576.jpg)

*Originally published at [dbhurley.com](http://dbhurley.com/recognizing-mautic-code-contributors/).*

Recently I decided to do a little digging into Mautic’s contributor logs to see who was doing big things when it comes to Mautic’s marketing automation code. I also wanted to compare how we compared 2016 to 2017 since we’re fast approaching the end of 2017. It seems hard to believe that we’re almost ready to close the book on another year!

I thought the best thing to do would be to look at a variety of stats first comparing different metrics between last year and this year. One thing that I believe is very important to mention at the beginning before we start looking at specific numbers is how much of Mautic community growth can NOT be measured by a number or a specific number of lines of code. The following metrics simply report on one aspect of the overall community and should in no wise be considered indicative of the community as a whole (good or bad). The code aspect is merely one facet of our community.


### Number of Developers


The number of developers contributing code to Mautic can be viewed in several different ways so I’ll share a few of them and let you draw your own conclusions.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2016_2017_code_contributions.png)


This first graph shows the growth of developers and reviewers over the past two years. As you can see we have a steady increase in the number of “contributors” over the past 24 months. This time period covers Mautic versions 1.2 through 2.11 and does not include the month of December of this year, 2017. There are significantly more reviewers than developers but this is expected and both are still considered contributors as Mautic requires reviews to be done before a pull request can be merged. The Mautic company is identified by the dark grey in the chart as well. You can see that although proportionally Mautic the company (MCO) contributes the greatest number of developers than other companies there are increasingly more and more months developers and reviewers from the community.


> There is an important side note that should be considered when reviewing the number of contributors and the relationship between MCO engineers and community developers. The amount of code contributed by MCO engineers comprises approximately 82%. This means that although the number of developers in the community is increasing MCO is still the largest single contributor by a significant amount.


But just to give a bit more recognition I’d like to share a specific list of the top 20 individuals who have contributed code to Mautic in the past year. This list isn’t exhaustive; there are many more (as the stats above demonstrate). But these individuals deserve a special specific callout for their work. Here is a list of the top 20 individuals and the number of lines of code they have contributed to Mautic.



- [alanhartless](https://github.com/alanhartless)*, 91179
- [escopecz](https://github.com/escopecz)*, 55362
- [dongilbert](https://github.com/dongilbert)*, 39954

But code contribution is more than just lines of code. (I’ll be the first to suggest that the number of lines of code may be a terrible metric for judging activity…more on that later). So here is a second list. This list recognizes the top 20 individuals and the number of merged pull requests to the Mautic code. Again, they each deserve recognition for their contributions.

### Comments & Pull Requests


The second chart I would like to share with you is in relation to the overall comments and pull requests that the Mautic codebase has received over the previous 24 months.

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2016_2017_pull_requests_comments.png)


This chart highlights the pull requests (in red) and the comments (in blue) as they have occurred since January 2016. Here again we see a gradual increase in contributions (trend lines added). As you would expect the amount of discussion surrounding code contributions increases over time and there is a gradual increase in the number of pull requests submitted as well. Peaks typically correspond with the various release dates of the Mautic code.


### Code Comment Growth


The next chart demonstrates a comparison between comments on code between last year and this year (again keeping in mind that this year we are not showing data from the month of December).

![](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2016_vs_2017_comments.png)


I share this chart because it signifies the engagement aspect from the community. Again, comments and involvement increases around release times as you would expect, but the overall trend line demonstrates increased discussion occurring around the code over time.


> *Of course all of these charts above are specifically related to the pull requests submitted and as a result there is a significant portion of the contributor engagement that is not represented by these charts. The reason for this lies in the feature request section of GitHub. Feature requests are ideas generated by the community for future consideration within Mautic. Because they are not associated with a specific pull request they do not show in the above stats.*



### Current Code Status


Let’s now take a look at our current GitHub status and repositories and draw some conclusions about where we have come and where we are going to go from here. This is also a chance to identify ways we need to improve processes and new areas of focus for 2018.

Currently in GitHub there are 726 issues and 103 pull requests. Breaking the issues down further we have the following stats:



- 321 issues marked as Bugs
- 308 issues marked as Feature Requests
- 171 issues marked as Backlog
- 98 issues not labeled
- 20 issues marked as Pending Feedback



There are several conclusions we can draw from this. First, because we use GitHub for our bugs and feature tracking there is a slight skewing of perception when viewing the open issues on Mautic. Instead of there being almost 730 “bugs” in Mautic code, it is better to view this list with the appropriate filter applied. When you do this you’ll find that the relationship of bugs to pull requests is much closer to a reasonable ratio with 1 pull request existing for every 3 bugs.

**The second item that is a problem for Mautic is the 98 issues that are currently unlabeled.** This means someone has written up an issue but it has not been reviewed by anyone with appropriate permissions for applying a label. This is a problem. There are two possible explanations. Either we don’t have enough active community members monitoring the GitHub repositories to mark new issues with the appropriate labels or we don’t have enough community members with the knowledge to apply the appropriate labels and therefore they don’t add them.


> *Side Note: There’s also the problem presented by GitHub repositories and permissions that allow or disallow access to label creation and application of those labels. This is something Mautic has not yet solved successfully.*


In the future we need to educate community members on reading and assigning labels to issues so that they can be correctly categorize as they are created. We also need to determine the number of community volunteers actively monitoring GitHub repositories. One of the first ways we can determine this number is by looking at the number of reviewers we saw in the charts earlier. This number gives a suitable estimates of those contributors capable of responding to issues and therefore also capable of attaching labels to issues.

There are several advantages to correctly categorizing issues. With proper categorization we can more readily identify which bugs need to be resolved first and which are feature requests instead of actual bugs. **This will increase productivity from the developers writing pull requests as well as clarify public understanding of the project’s status.**

Lastly, from the list of issue stats we can see that there are a significant amount of feature requests. We can draw a conclusion or two from this metric as well. Feature requests can mean the software is not completely fulfilling everyone’s ideal marketing solution (though this is a more delicate issue as Mautic should never attempt to be all things for all people). More importantly the relationship between number of feature requests submitted and number of pull requests submitted suggests that the community is made up of more end-users (marketers) or implementer types of users rather than coders or developers. In fact, when we take this ratio and compare it to the downloads from Mautic.org of the software we find a fairly similar breakdown of user types. This means the assumption we draw from the feature request submissions is accurate.

Understanding the make-up of our community when it comes to the Mautic code helps us to continue making improvements and growing. I hope that as you have read through this you’ve been able to get a better understanding of how I look at things and what the different metrics you might see or hear actually mean. Once we have a shared understanding of how to look at the Mautic codebase we will have a greater opportunity for moving faster.', '<img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/light-sign-typography-lighting-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="405" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-3491" />

The amount of code contributed by MCO engineers comprises approximately 82%. This means that although the number of developers in the community is increasing MCO is still the largest single contributor by a significant amount.</blockquote>

But just to give a bit more recognition I’d like to share a specific list of the top 20 individuals who have contributed code to Mautic in the past year. This list isn’t exhaustive; there are many more (as the stats above demonstrate). But these individuals deserve a special specific callout for their work. Here is a list of the top 20 individuals and the number of lines of code they have contributed to Mautic.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alanhartless">alanhartless</a>*, 91179</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/escopecz">escopecz</a>*, 55362</li>

<li><a href="https://github.com/Dreiser">Dreiser</a>*, 634</li>
</ul>

But code contribution is more than just lines of code. (I’ll be the first to suggest that the number of lines of code may be a terrible metric for judging activity…more on that later). So here is a second list. This list recognizes the top 20 individuals and the number of merged pull requests to the Mautic code. Again, they each deserve recognition for their contributions.

<h3>Comments & Pull Requests</h3>

The second chart I would like to share with you is in relation to the overall comments and pull requests that the Mautic codebase has received over the previous 24 months.

<img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2016_2017_pull_requests_comments.png" alt="" width="884" height="547" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3485" />

This chart highlights the pull requests (in red) and the comments (in blue) as they have occurred since January 2016. Here again we see a gradual increase in contributions (trend lines added). As you would expect the amount of discussion surrounding code contributions increases over time and there is a gradual increase in the number of pull requests submitted as well. Peaks typically correspond with the various release dates of the Mautic code.

<h3>Code Comment Growth</h3>

The next chart demonstrates a comparison between comments on code between last year and this year (again keeping in mind that this year we are not showing data from the month of December).

<img src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/2016_vs_2017_comments.png" alt="" width="839" height="452" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3486" />

I share this chart because it signifies the engagement aspect from the community. Again, comments and involvement increases around release times as you would expect, but the overall trend line demonstrates increased discussion occurring around the code over time.

<blockquote><em>Of course all of these charts above are specifically related to the pull requests submitted and as a result there is a significant portion of the contributor engagement that is not represented by these charts. The reason for this lies in the feature request section of GitHub. Feature requests are ideas generated by the community for future consideration within Mautic. Because they are not associated with a specific pull request they do not show in the above stats.</em></blockquote>

<h3>Current Code Status</h3>

Let’s now take a look at our current GitHub status and repositories and draw some conclusions about where we have come and where we are going to go from here. This is also a chance to identify ways we need to improve processes and new areas of focus for 2018.

Currently in GitHub there are 726 issues and 103 pull requests. Breaking the issues down further we have the following stats:

<ul>
<li>321 issues marked as Bugs</li>
<li>308 issues marked as Feature Requests</li>
<li>171 issues marked as Backlog</li>
<li>98 issues not labeled</li>
<li>20 issues marked as Pending Feedback</li>
</ul>

There are several conclusions we can draw from this. First, because we use GitHub for our bugs and feature tracking there is a slight skewing of perception when viewing the open issues on Mautic. Instead of there being almost 730 “bugs” in Mautic code, it is better to view this list with the appropriate filter applied. When you do this you’ll find that the relationship of bugs to pull requests is much closer to a reasonable ratio with 1 pull request existing for every 3 bugs.

<strong>The second item that is a problem for Mautic is the 98 issues that are currently unlabeled.</strong> This means someone has written up an issue but it has not been reviewed by anyone with appropriate permissions for applying a label. This is a problem. There are two possible explanations. Either we don’t have enough active community members monitoring the GitHub repositories to mark new issues with the appropriate labels or we don’t have enough community members with the knowledge to apply the appropriate labels and therefore they don’t add them.

<blockquote><em>Side Note: There’s also the problem presented by GitHub repositories and permissions that allow or disallow access to label creation and application of those labels. This is something Mautic has not yet solved successfully.</em></blockquote>

In the future we need to educate community members on reading and assigning labels to issues so that they can be correctly categorize as they are created. We also need to determine the number of community volunteers actively monitoring GitHub repositories. One of the first ways we can determine this number is by looking at the number of reviewers we saw in the charts earlier. This number gives a suitable estimates of those contributors capable of responding to issues and therefore also capable of attaching labels to issues.

There are several advantages to correctly categorizing issues. With proper categorization we can more readily identify which bugs need to be resolved first and which are feature requests instead of actual bugs. <strong>This will increase productivity from the developers writing pull requests as well as clarify public understanding of the project’s status.</strong>

Lastly, from the list of issue stats we can see that there are a significant amount of feature requests. We can draw a conclusion or two from this metric as well. Feature requests can mean the software is not completely fulfilling everyone’s ideal marketing solution (though this is a more delicate issue as Mautic should never attempt to be all things for all people). More importantly the relationship between number of feature requests submitted and number of pull requests submitted suggests that the community is made up of more end-users (marketers) or implementer types of users rather than coders or developers. In fact, when we take this ratio and compare it to the downloads from Mautic.org of the software we find a fairly similar breakdown of user types. This means the assumption we draw from the feature request submissions is accurate.

Understanding the make-up of our community when it comes to the Mautic code helps us to continue making improvements and growing. I hope that as you have read through this you’ve been able to get a better understanding of how I look at things and what the different metrics you might see or hear actually mean. Once we have a shared understanding of how to look at the Mautic codebase we will have a greater opportunity for moving faster.

Everyone gets excited when a new version of Mautic is released. We all rush to the website to see what all has been added or fixed. In a way it’s a bit like Christmas morning (if you celebrate that holiday I’m sure you understand). That rush of excitement, the eager anticipation, and unwrapping the new features as you start to read. But there’s something that gets overlooked. Someone had to write that article. Someone had to compile the new features, organize the thoughts and create a post that you can read. In the Mautic community that person is Jeff Seevers. With each new release he works behind the scenes, taking a list of features and bug fixes and crafting them into a story. And we have all benefited from his hard work.



> Maybe it wasn’t a new release announcement where you first ran into Jeff. That’s easy to imagine because he stays busy in so many different areas of the Mautic community, whether it was the forums, the social media channels, or the Slack channels you could find Jeff working, talking, always looking for ways to empower people and encourage volunteers.

Wherever you may have met Jeff I am sure it was a memorable moment. He’s been a friendly face around Mautic for a good part of the last year. And because of that familiarity it makes the future a little bit harder. I am both a little sad and also excited to share that Jeff will be moving on from Mautic to other things. I’m saddened because the Mautic community will lose a powerful advocate and a strong voice in the day to day Mautic dealings. But I’m excited because even as Jeff seeks out a new challenge in a different role I know Mautic will continue to be a part of his life. His dedication and commitment to what we are doing in Mautic will not end simply due to a change in his title or company.

This gives me the opportunity to share with you a thought that I hope will remain with you long after you finish reading this post. Your company, your “day job” does not limit you from being a part of the Mautic community. **Our community is full of incredible individuals volunteering their time when they have it.** Don’t be discouraged because you have other obligations. Mautic is the community you can be a part of without sacrificing your other jobs. In fact, Mautic is built on the foundation of those who contribute and volunteer as their time permits. And isn’t that the real message to remember?

And so I hope you will join me in thanking Jeff for all his hard work in Mautic and celebrate the beauty of an open source community where everyone can volunteer and take part in a leadership role.

Oh, and just in case you’re thinking about it but not quite sure…yes, **there’s a volunteer community position now open**. If you’re interested in playing a bigger part in Mautic and joining the leadership team in this capacity (or some other) - please reach out and let someone know. Whether it’s me, or Jeff, or someone else, I encourage you to not be shy. Be bold, step up, and find out how fulfilling a leadership position can be.

Jeff, we wish you the best in your next career and we’re thankful you’ll still be a part of the Mautic community no matter where your journey takes you!', '<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-102247" src="https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/hands-1947915_1280-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="576" />

Every project is different. As a result every project has different methods and processes for how things are handled. In the case of software projects using GitHub (as Mautic does) for code and issue management there are several different ways in which the platform is used. And sometimes that usage has to change over time. Mautic is still a very young project and we’re learning as we grow. This is both exciting and fun but also can be a bit of a headache at times.

No one likes change and yet sometimes changes are inevitable for future growth and improvement. We must make changes not for the sake of change but for the sake of progress. And although at times these changes might be hard if it’s for the betterment of the product then we need to make those changes regardless of how difficult they might be.

### The Reason for Change

As the title to this post suggests we are about to make one of those difficult changes. Historically Mautic has used GitHub for tracking code and code changes as well as issues and feature requests. All in the same repository. Again, this is not a problem as many projects may choose to organize their code and issues/features in this way. But as Mautic has grown we have begun to uncover a problem with this approach. By mixing in feature requests and issues it becomes too easy for things to be lost, (both issues and feature requests) and as a result both developers and contributors are frustrated.

In addition, this current organizational structure just looks bad for our project. Feature requests are ways we can improve our product as a community, and yet GitHub’s structure lists them as “issues” meaning “problems” with the code. This gives new contributors a completely wrong impression of our community and the work we’re doing.

### Changing Mautic Feature Requests

But we have an opportunity for an improvement. Unlike other projects on GitHub we also have a vibrant and very active community on our website. We also have an excellent forum home where everyone can post and contribute. We even have a forum entitled, Ideas. This naturally leads to the next step in our community growth and evolution. **We will be moving feature requests away from GitHub and into the [Ideas Forum](https://www.mautic.org/forums/forum/ideas/)**. This will accomplish several important things all at once. First, it will clean up the issues on GitHub to only list those things that are truly “issues” with the code that need to be addressed. Second, it will improve the level of communication and engagement for those ideas by placing them in an active forum where many more people can contribute.

This change means a couple things and will be easy to implement moving forward. They are listed here in bullet point format to provide an easy reference.


 	- If a feature request is **an ‘idea’ with no proof of concept code** then it should be placed in the [Ideas forum](https://www.mautic.org/forums/forum/ideas/) on the Mautic community website.
 	- If a feature request **has code ready to be reviewed, or commented on**, then it should be created on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/mautic/mautic/issues) and labeled with Feature Request.


*Any feature request that is placed on GitHub but belongs in the Idea forum it will be closed automatically with a comment that it should be re-created in the Idea forum.*

### The Improvements from Change

The transition period may be difficult, but as mentioned previously, even though change can be hard, it can be good. This change will be great for our community and will improve the overall success of Mautic. We will experience greater contributions and better discussion around new features. We will continue to build an amazing product together and show the rest of the world how marketing automation should be done.

INSERT INTO mtorg_db.rainlab_blog_posts (id, user_id, title, slug, excerpt, content, content_html, published_at, published, created_at, updated_at) VALUES (104310, 0, 'Mautic and GDPR', 'mautic-and-gdpr', '', '![gdpr mautic eu policy regulation](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/europe-3220293_1920-1024x678.jpg)


*Originally published: [http://dbhurley.com/mautic-and-gdpr](http://dbhurley.com/mautic-and-gdpr)*

One of the hottest topics circulating the internet these days is the upcoming legislation surrounding GDPR being put into effect on May 25, 2018. Companies of all sizes are closely watching what this legislation means and taking a hard look at their software to see what is affected. Given the hefty fines, this scrutiny and concern is completely understandable. Mautic, as an open source marketing automation platform and community also holds these concerns and possibly to a much higher degree than others. Our community has hundreds of thousands of businesses running Mautic, and our software is powering their marketing automation effort and customer data collection.

As a result, Mautic is of course highly interested in not only understanding, but also complying with any and all new regulations put forth that promote openness and transparency. Interested isn’t really the right word - more like *actively engaged*. We are dedicated to ensuring that our software not only complies but stands out as a model by which others gauge their own level of implementation.

Before I get too far into those details, let me give a very brief refresh on what GDPR means and what it represents.

### GDPR

**GDPR**, or General Data Protection Regulation, is a new European regulation that enforces the protection and accessibility of personal data for all European citizens. [Read more](https://www.eugdpr.org/)

## Four basic user entitlements
1. Every individual is allowed to know what data is kept by any business; why that data is kept and for how long it’s stored by the business.
2. Every individual has the “Right to Access” their own information and data.
3. Every individual has the “Right to Data Portability” of their information (they can request a copy of their data as it’s stored.)
4. Every individual has the “Right to be Forgotten”. (Request a business change and permanently delete any stored data)

> Now you may be one of the shrewd ones and recognize a specific phrase in the original definition: that’s right the word European. But if you’re reading this from the US, you’re not off the hook just yet. Keep reading.

This new regulation applies to European citizens regardless of where they are located at any time. US companies must abide by these guidelines for any and all customers, contacts, accounts associated with the European Union.

### Personal Data

There is one last aspect of the GDPR we need to consider before getting into some specifics. **What is personal data?** That’s right the GDPR is concerned with the **data** so obviously we need to understand what that data is. *And this is where things get a little bit muddy*. Here’s a short list of the most commonly recognized types of information that falls under this regulation.


 	- Online identifies (IP addresses, mobile device IDs, browser info, MAC addresses, cookies, account IDs, and other forms of system generated user identifiable data)
 	- Racial or ethnic origin
 	- Political opinions
 	- Religious or philosophical beliefs
 	- Trade union memberships
 	- Health data
 	- Sex life or sexual orientation
 	- Past or spent criminal convictions
 	- Genetic & biometric data
 	- Location data
 	- Pseudonymized data


Whew, what a list! Now that we have a bit of a handle on what the GDPR is about (at least at a high level) and you may be sufficiently uneasy about your current software I want to share how Mautic as a product is already compliant and continues to seek the best and most proactive approach in these new guidelines.

### Dual Approach

Based on the four principles listed above let’s look at an optimal Mautic configuration that complies with them. There are two options that existed for Mautic and my desire was to set a precedent for our community, our product and the entire marketing automation space. As I dug into this issue I met with more individuals in our community and in business than I could mention. My desire was to get a better understanding of the regulations and their implications myself. And I am excited to share with you the conclusions I’ve come to. And of course I’m *always interested in more discussions on the subject* and welcome the opportunity to chat with anyone that has questions, ideas or thoughts on this subject. It’s an important one.

Okay, with all that said, let’s dig in. As I mentioned there are 2 paths we can take. The real trouble lies in the uncertainty. I alluded to it earlier when I mentioned the “muddy” aspects of the data. There is a balance that must be struck. Mautic should be proactive and a leader in the implementation of these new guidelines. But time spent on unclear work, or without good direction is wasted and the time of our community developers is far too important to waste.

In order to make the absolutely best use of the developers in our community’s time; and in an effort to make the wisest decision in time and resources I believe the smartest strategy is to take a dual-prong approach. **This is exciting because Mautic software can be easily configured for GDPR regulations today with just a few simple steps.**

### Instant GDPR Compliance

This dual prong approach involves an immediate step and a longer term software feature enhancement. The first step is quick and relatively painless. And with the implementation of a few simple changes to how you currently setup your Mautic instance you’ll be instantly compliant!

Here’s all you will need to do:


 	2. *The very first thing is to plan how to convey and accept explicit data collection consent, usually done through a focus element in Mautic, this step is potentially already being done in the case of cookie collection. As such you may only need to modify the language of your existing focus item.*
 	4. Configure two new segments within your Mautic software, name these segments, **Request to be Forgotten** and **Data Requested**.
 	6. Setup a new form that allows an individual to submit their name/email and select the options they wish to submit (**Request for Data**, **Request to be Forgotten**)
 	8. After each form submission associate them with the correct segment and take the necessary steps to either delete the contact from the database or export their record to a CSV.
 	10. Notify the individual of the action taken.


One of the biggest (and simplest) mistakes I hear is people getting caught up in the thinking that this process needs to be **instantaneous**. While of course each request does need to be handled with expediency, nothing states it needs to be automated. To the best of my understanding, the above 4 step process gives you a GDPR compliant Mautic! Congratulations, you can sleep a little easier.

### GDPR Mautic Software Improvements (Future)

Of course being compliant in this manner is only the first of the two-phase strategy. The second involves some modifications and improvements to the Mautic software. And while this is yet to be fully determined I can share a few ideas that have been circulating.


 	2. New configuration section for GDPR.
 	4. Configuration options that add the necessary acknowledgement checkboxes to forms automatically.
 	6. A semi-automated contact deletion process


This is just for starters and only a few thoughts I’ve had as I’ve listened to some of our European community members share their concerns and their ideas. As I stated earlier I would love to speak with you and continue this discussion. Mautic is committed to being a leader in this regard and demonstrating to others how proper GDPR should be handled. *We have the knowledge of a global community and the power of a flexible and open source development platform enabling us*. Our software can be proactive and our software can demonstrate how others should consider GDPR compliancy.

One of the hottest topics circulating the internet these days is the upcoming legislation surrounding GDPR being put into effect on May 25, 2018. Companies of all sizes are closely watching what this legislation means and taking a hard look at their software to see what is affected. Given the hefty fines, this scrutiny and concern is completely understandable. Mautic, as an open source marketing automation platform and community also holds these concerns and possibly to a much higher degree than others. Our community has hundreds of thousands of businesses running Mautic, and our software is powering their marketing automation effort and customer data collection.
<!--more-->
As a result, Mautic is of course highly interested in not only understanding, but also complying with any and all new regulations put forth that promote openness and transparency. Interested isn’t really the right word - more like <em>actively engaged</em>. We are dedicated to ensuring that our software not only complies but stands out as a model by which others gauge their own level of implementation.

Before I get too far into those details, let me give a very brief refresh on what GDPR means and what it represents.
<h3>GDPR</h3>
<strong>GDPR</strong>, or General Data Protection Regulation, is a new European regulation that enforces the protection and accessibility of personal data for all European citizens. [Read more](https://www.eugdpr.org/)

## Four basic user entitlements
1. Every individual is allowed to know what data is kept by any business; why that data is kept and for how long it’s stored by the business.
2. Every individual has the “Right to Access” their own information and data.
3. Every individual has the “Right to Data Portability” of their information (they can request a copy of their data as it’s stored.)
4. Every individual has the “Right to be Forgotten”. (Request a business change and permanently delete any stored data)
<blockquote>Now you may be one of the shrewd ones and recognize a specific phrase in the original definition: that’s right the word European. But if you’re reading this from the US, you’re not off the hook just yet. Keep reading.</blockquote>
This new regulation applies to European citizens regardless of where they are located at any time. US companies must abide by these guidelines for any and all customers, contacts, accounts associated with the European Union.
<h3>Personal Data</h3>
There is one last aspect of the GDPR we need to consider before getting into some specifics. <strong>What is personal data?</strong> That’s right the GDPR is concerned with the <strong>data</strong> so obviously we need to understand what that data is. <em>And this is where things get a little bit muddy</em>. Here’s a short list of the most commonly recognized types of information that falls under this regulation.
<ul>
 	<li>Online identifies (IP addresses, mobile device IDs, browser info, MAC addresses, cookies, account IDs, and other forms of system generated user identifiable data)</li>
 	<li>Racial or ethnic origin</li>
 	<li>Political opinions</li>
 	<li>Religious or philosophical beliefs</li>
 	<li>Trade union memberships</li>
 	<li>Health data</li>
 	<li>Sex life or sexual orientation</li>
 	<li>Past or spent criminal convictions</li>
 	<li>Genetic &amp; biometric data</li>
 	<li>Location data</li>
 	<li>Pseudonymized data</li>
</ul>
Whew, what a list! Now that we have a bit of a handle on what the GDPR is about (at least at a high level) and you may be sufficiently uneasy about your current software I want to share how Mautic as a product is already compliant and continues to seek the best and most proactive approach in these new guidelines.
<h3>Dual Approach</h3>
Based on the four principles listed above let’s look at an optimal Mautic configuration that complies with them. There are two options that existed for Mautic and my desire was to set a precedent for our community, our product and the entire marketing automation space. As I dug into this issue I met with more individuals in our community and in business than I could mention. My desire was to get a better understanding of the regulations and their implications myself. And I am excited to share with you the conclusions I’ve come to. And of course I’m <em>always interested in more discussions on the subject</em> and welcome the opportunity to chat with anyone that has questions, ideas or thoughts on this subject. It’s an important one.

Okay, with all that said, let’s dig in. As I mentioned there are 2 paths we can take. The real trouble lies in the uncertainty. I alluded to it earlier when I mentioned the “muddy” aspects of the data. There is a balance that must be struck. Mautic should be proactive and a leader in the implementation of these new guidelines. But time spent on unclear work, or without good direction is wasted and the time of our community developers is far too important to waste.

In order to make the absolutely best use of the developers in our community’s time; and in an effort to make the wisest decision in time and resources I believe the smartest strategy is to take a dual-prong approach. <strong>This is exciting because Mautic software can be easily configured for GDPR regulations today with just a few simple steps.</strong>
<h3>Instant GDPR Compliance</h3>
This dual prong approach involves an immediate step and a longer term software feature enhancement. The first step is quick and relatively painless. And with the implementation of a few simple changes to how you currently setup your Mautic instance you’ll be instantly compliant!

Here’s all you will need to do:
<ol>
 	<li><em>The very first thing is to plan how to convey and accept explicit data collection consent, usually done through a focus element in Mautic, this step is potentially already being done in the case of cookie collection.

 	<li>Configure two new segments within your Mautic software, name these segments, <strong>Request to be Forgotten</strong> and <strong>Data Requested</strong>.</li>
 	<li>Setup a new form that allows an individual to submit their name/email and select the options they wish to submit (<strong>Request for Data</strong>, <strong>Request to be Forgotten</strong>)</li>
 	<li>After each form submission associate them with the correct segment and take the necessary steps to either delete the contact from the database or export their record to a CSV.</li>
 	<li>Notify the individual of the action taken.</li>
</ol>
One of the biggest (and simplest) mistakes I hear is people getting caught up in the thinking that this process needs to be <strong>instantaneous</strong>. While of course each request does need to be handled with expediency, nothing states it needs to be automated.

*Originally published on [http://dbhurley.com/headless-marketing-automation/](http://dbhurley.com/headless-marketing-automation/)*

Yesterday I released a blog post entitled [Looking Ahead at Mautic 3](http://dbhurley.com/looking-ahead-to-mautic-3/). This blog went into great detail on why I believed a Mautic 3 should be considered next on our product roadmap and then I outlined the problems (as well as some solutions) that we could solve with this next release. One of the features I shared received a few more questions than the others so I think it deserves a little bit of specialized attention. 

## An API First Headless Application

First of all can we all admit that is a mouthful to say? We can break it down and make it a bit easier to understand and then let’s dig into what it means and why I believe it’s a valuable step for Mautic’s future.

**API First** implies that every function of Mautic, every call to the database, and every interaction has to be “call driven”. This extracts the front end user-experience from the data layer (or API). This also means that the only way that the user interface (design, page layout, display elements) interacts with the data is through a series of API calls. These calls are the glue that holds the data together. API first means the system has been created in a way that the API is the only way these things happen, and every API return is formatted accordingly.

**Headless**: This concept is a funny one to discuss when working in software and applications. We’re not getting into the Ichabod Crane story /(though admittedly for some reason a character on a horse holding a pumpkin is inevitably the first thing that comes to my mind)/. In the software universe the concept of headless means something quite different. Here’s a definition:

> …the front-end is a stand-alone piece of software, which through API communicates with a back-end. Both parts operate separately from each other, and can even be placed on separate servers, creating a minimum version of a multi-server architecture. The bridge between both parts is the API client. The endpoints of the API are connected to each other….
— [Headless software - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Headless_software)

Earlier in that same page the first sentence distills it down even further. **Headless software is software capable of working on a device without a graphical user interface.** (Wikipedia)

By these definitions we see that headless makes sense particularly when discussing things such as *API first*.

Now, let’s take that thinking and put it into more of a practical application. Why is a headless marketing automation platform useful and desirable. Why should Mautic consider this something worth undertaking in the next major release of our software? Here are my three main points to justify such a task.

## Flexibility

In my opinion, the first reason to consider undertaking a task of this size is based on the concept of improving our flexibility as a platform. If our goal is to be “open” (more on that later) then the best way we can do that is by having a platform that is flexible.

Flexibility, to me, means continuing the great work we stated where a business is able to use the software in a way that is best for their business (rather than the situation that 90% of other software operates). We want to give people the ability and the ***flexibility*** to be in complete control of their information, their data, and their software. Software flexibility comes in a variety of ways; in Mautic we’ve considered our platform flexible from the very beginning. Custom fields, highly customizable and configurable campaigns, and the ability to create software practices that match a particular business have been part of the product from the start.

The next logical step in this effort to be flexible and to continue to push the limits and lead in this area involves looking deeper at other areas where we can implement more flexibility. Separating the functional layer from the user interface allows just that. A platform where you can consume the data from any interface you desire means you have a marketing automation platform prepared for the future. Your data, made available in any manner you need. API first, headless marketing automation gives you the power of marketing automation in any visual, end product you desire.

## Sustainability

The second reason I believe we should focus on a headless approach to marketing automation is for future sustainability. I don’t mean sustainability of Mautic necessarily, but more importantly stability of your data. If you are locked into a single user interface then you’ll find yourself duplicating data, moving between different databases and potentially losing information. You’ll also be tied to a more narrow focus and implementation strategy for your marketing automation because you’ll only be able to use Mautic in the manner envisioned by the Mautic community and its developers.

While this isn’t necessarily a bad thing (we’ve got a pretty good roadmap and vision for where marketing automation should be), I believe the ability for a business to use their data in multiple outlets gives a sense of sustainability to the database and security in knowing the functional aspects of the software is capable of being implemented in a variety of ways. <span class="highlight">You move from a singular marketing automation-platform-only to a situation where your data (and your marketing functionality) is able to be consumed everywhere by any other service or device.</span>

## Openness

The final reason I believe that a headless marketing automation platform is beneficial is for the sake of being more open. Mautic is built on open source. We are steeped in the knowledge that our code is readily available to anyone to review, to use, and to improve. This means that every function is understood (or could be), and that every action the software performs is easy to observe. If we continue this line of thinking it stands to reason that in much the same way, the data, and the output from those functions be easy to view, to use, and to improve. By extracting the user interface from the software and making the underlying infrastructure (API) available to be consumed by other sources we make Mautic more open.

No other marketing automation platform gives you this API-first, headless ability. You are essentially “locked in” to their user interface and their experience. (*And we don’t even need to start talking about the limited API abilities of marketing automation platforms in general.*) Closed marketing automation constricts and restricts your abilities as a marketer. You are forced to understand their interface, and to only view your data within the bounds of what they believe is marketing automation and how they believe you should access your information.

Mautic has always sought to do more, to be more. To provide you access to everything — after all, it belongs to you. Shouldn’t it be able to be used any way you want?

------

For these reasons I believe it is in best interests and the future success of Mautic to become API-first and truly headless. I hope this shares my thinking in a bit more clarity and if you were unsure before what headless meant you now have a good understanding about the topic.

If you have ideas or other ways in which a headless marketing automation platform can change the landscape and improve marketing I would love to hear them. We’re building this together, our robust and global community of marketers and developers working together create Mautic software and we have the power to envision and create the future. We are changing the landscape and we will continue to do so. **It’s an exciting time to be in Mautic.**
