This first tutorial in the **Theme Creation 101** tutorial series we look at the overall structure of your themes folder, files, and the necessary core files you will need to create. Later tutorials in this series will be focused on specific aspects such as email marketing templates, landing page design and other details. Here we also briefly explore the [config.php](https://github.com/mautic/sample-theme/blob/master/awesome/config.php) file that will be used by Mautic to identify and use your new theme.

Hopefully these short videos will give you the information you need to create powerful themes. You can then use in your marketing automation to give your users flexibility to create dynamic content while adhering to a fundamental base design that maintains a strong brand presence.

As we develop this theme together the files we create will be made available via [a github repository](https://github.com/mautic/sample-theme) and you will be able to use this theme as an example when you build your own themes later. You can clone this repo to keep up-to-date as we work through this tutorial series.
