### Batman V Superman: Dawn Of Justice Viral Marketing Continues On LexCorp Website

An important aspect of viral marketing is making fans feel like they are taking part in the world of the film that’s being hyped, and so, WB has chosen to portray LexCorp as an actual entity, and it’s made for some entertaining moments and reveals. For one, there was the faux interview with Fortune that revealed that Jesse Eisenberg is, in fact, playing Lex Luthor Jr. in the upcoming blockbuster. This undeservedly caused quite a stir, as many fanboys did not realize that pre-New 52 Luthor was technically Lex Luthor Jr.

### How Arby's Broke Its Marketing Slump and Became One of Today's Beefiest Brands

The brand's turning point arrived about two years ago. It was either going to crash and burn or rise to the challenge of its teetering brand. The difficulty was figuring out what made the brand special and what it stood for.

The team came to a consensus on what was at the core of the Arby's brand: meat.

We don't push content and ads through our social media channels. We listen,” said Arby's Restaurant Group brand president and CMO Robert Lynch.

### How Lego's Marketing Vp Led the Awesome Team that Stole the Oscars

Though The Lego Movie, a fan favorite and $468 million blockbuster, earned not a single nomination in the animated feature category, the 83-year-old Danish toy company proved it didn't need one. During a two-and-a-half-minute rendition of "Everything Is Awesome," dancers fanned out through the audience to hand yellow Oscar statuettes (made from Lego bricks, naturally) to the likes of Meryl Streep, Clint Eastwood and, most memorably, Oprah Winfrey, whose look of surprise and delight reached 35 million viewers. In fact, according to data crunched by Amobee Brand Intelligence, Lego dominated the night with close to 47,000 social mentions and 44 percent of the real-time discussion. That little Oscar trick handed the toy brand some $7.5 million of free advertising. Not a bad night for a loser.
