We're quite excited to announce the availability of the 1.0.0 Release Candidate for Mautic. **This is our final release candidate before the 1.0.0 stable release.** Like always we've found an *insane* number of things to improve! Read below to learn about them.  

    It never seems to fail that just when you're about to release something you find a problem that needs a solution. Of course Mautic is no different. This 1.0.0 release candidate is full of solutions. We have taken this last opportunity for massive improvements to make some incredible changes. All for the better and all tested and ready for you to use. This release candidate addresses a total of **92 improvements** (we prefer to not call any of them *bugs*).   

  
### Notable Improvement
 We have one improvement which we have deemed worthy of a notable mention. In this release we have modified the page and routing structure to better support friendly URL's and improve readability of the routing. Don't worry though, we are fully backwards compatible with the older URL's so nothing will break. Moving forward all of your "internal" or secure pages will be located behind a URL with `/s/` in the URL. (e.g. Login page is now `http://your-mautic.com/s/login`). This is for a good reason. Now your landing pages and other public pages are much simpler and prettier!  

  
### All Other Improvements
 You can read a full detailed list of all the other fixes and features on [GitHub](https://github.com/mautic/mautic/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc1). Read and you'll be amazed at all that has gone into this release. It's incredible to see this many improvements in such a short time. **Seriously, go read this! **
