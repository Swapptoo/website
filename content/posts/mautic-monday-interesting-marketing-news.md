### Pro Prankster Perfect Viral Marketing

Using the Car Lister auto-buying platform is as easy as lifting the front wheels of a Ford Escape taxi off the ground. At least that’s what the pranksters at ad agency Thinkmodo wanted you to believe in a recent stunt. Car Lister’s CEO enlisted the New York viral-marketing agency to pull off a stunt to bring more visibility to the site, which allows dealerships and private owners to sell vehicles in a community-like setting with the help of photos and video previews.

Banners had the lowest ad recall rates. Thirty-three percent of people who looked at banner ads on a desktop remembered seeing the ad later. The same percentage of people who saw it on multiple devices remembered seeing ads, meaning that solo desktop banners are just as effective as cross-screen standard ads, even though brands pay extra for smartphone and tablet ads.
