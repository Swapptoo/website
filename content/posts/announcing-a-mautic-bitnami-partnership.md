There are some partnerships which you just know are a good fit. Long before Mautic was even released stable to the world, we saw the amazing opportunities provided by Bitnami. We understood the platform they provided, the visibility they generated, and the tremendous support they offered to those using their services. Even more exciting was discovering Bitnami felt the same way about Mautic. We heard from them early on how much they believed in what we were doing and the power of open source marketing automation software. They were as eager to work with our community as we were to work with them. A partnership between our two organizations was obvious.

### Another Mautic Milestone

As a result of many discussions, and several months working closely together we are excited to announce the immediate availability of [Mautic on the Bitnami platform](https://bitnami.com/stack/mautic). This is a huge milestone for Mautic and we could not be more pleased with the progress our fast growing communityÂ has made in such a short time. Indeed, this exponential growth we are experiencing demonstrates just how much the world has been waiting for what we as a community have created.

### A Completely New Category

We are also excited to show just one more way Mautic is changing the world. When we initially met with Bitnami we were told they did not have a marketing automation category. We were going to be placed in a secondary CRM category instead. However, after our meetings and an opportunity to see all that Mautic offered ([lead monitoring and nurturing](https://www.mautic.org/blog/lead-management/), [email marketing](https://www.mautic.org/blog/email-marketing-level-one/), [drip marketing campaigns](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/), and more) they quickly decided to [create a marketing automation category](https://bitnami.com/stacks/marketing-automation) and Mautic once again leads the way.
