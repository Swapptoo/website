There are few things more exciting than getting together with others and learning about something that will revolutionize your business and ultimately your life.   

    The Mautic community has always believed in the power of the people and growing organically. One of the best ways to grow is through the enthusiastic praise of our existing community members as they interact with others. What better way to give everyone a chance to spread the word then organizing a specific time and place to get together and talk about Mautic. A meet-up. A **Mautic Meetup**.  

  We’re excited to announce the very first of these Mautic Meetups will be held in **Detroit, Michigan on Wednesday, February 25 at 6:30PM**. If you’re in the area and would like to learn more about Mautic, or maybe you already know Mautic but want to meet up with others working with Mautic then this is a great chance to do so. You’ll get any questions you may have regarding marketing automation answered and you’ll  have the opportunity to ask David any questions about Mautic and its community also. This truly is a fantastic opportunity and an exciting one as the first of many Mautic Meetups to come.
