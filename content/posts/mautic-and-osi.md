We are incredibly excited, as a community, to be able to announce publicly our acceptance as an affiliate member of the Open Source Initiative.   

   As an open source community we knew very early on that our philosophy and values were closely linked to those held by OSI. We connected with their mission and we were eager to demonstrate our shared values by becoming a member of their program.    

 
### Affirms Our Values
  This membership solidifies our goals and values and we believe assures everyone exploring Mautic that this community, and this amazing product, will always be a strong advocate for open source software. Mautic will always be free. Mautic will always be open source.    

 
### Another First
  Mautic is the first marketing automation platform to be fully open source. We also are excited to be the first software included in OSI focused on marketing of any kind.
