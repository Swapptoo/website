Each week we're going to try and share a tip related to Mautic you might find helpful! We'll make them short and sweet **and helpful**.  

    We all like to be efficient. One of the ways we can be faster is through the use of keyboard shortcuts! Yeah we know not everyone likes using the keyboard (that's why we have the handy-dandy icons at the top). But this shortcut is for all you keyboard aficionados.   

 
> **Tip:** When you're viewing your list of leads simply hit the "c" to switch views to **card** view. Want to return to **table** view, just hit the "t".
