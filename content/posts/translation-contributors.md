Our mission at Mautic is to provide global access to marketing automation through a strong open source [community](https://www.mautic.org/blog/community/). You are the ones who make it happen with your personal contributions to the Mautic community. Translating Mautic into your language does more than providing you with a powerful marketing tool, translation grants access to all who share your native language and gets us one step closer to global access.



[Mautic's Translation Initiative](https://www.mautic.org/blog/mautic-translation-initiative/) was started to reward those who chose to contribute through translation. We want to thank all of our contributors for your hard work and for being part of a project that's larger than any one of us.
