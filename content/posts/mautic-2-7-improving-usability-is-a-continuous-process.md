As marketers strive for creativity in the way they engage and connect with their audience, they are continuously looking for opportunities to save time and be more efficient. Who isn’t? We all add resources, tools and processes in an effort to accomplish more. That includes marketing automation. 

Since Mautic was first conceived, usability has been a strategic imperative. Each feature and bug fix is designed and implemented in a way that re-enforces our goal of saving time and improving the user experience. Our latest release is no different. It not only checks bugs off the list, the process of automating multi-channel communications keeps getting easier and easier. 


### Better Salesforce Mapping:



- Integrations should make sharing information easy. We’ve created a new interface for mapping fields between Mautic and Salesforce that makes the process a snap. Not only that, but you can now specify which system is the master for each mapped field. So if you determine that a contact phone number can only be updated in Salesforce, this data will flow from Salesforce to Mautic and not the other way around. 




### Improving the Editor Experience:



- The email and landing page editors have gotten a usability facelift. New types of content slots are available to help create and design the most engaging assets possible. Easily create and add different types of content such as images, text, social follows and gated video. We’ve also included the ability to add multi-column sections giving you more flexibility in designing your page or email.
