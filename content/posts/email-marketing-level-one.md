## Email Marketing Made Easy with Mautic

Not sure where to get started with something as overwhelming as marketing automation? We’ve got a great suggestion: Don’t jump directly into the deep end.  


A system as large as Mautic can be both exciting and intimidating. Rather than trying to step in and implement everything all at once consider an alternative. Most businesses are eager to keep in contact with their users and consider email marketing as a primary means for doing this. Instead of creating an account for email marketing and paying large sums of money on a monthly basis just for the purpose of sending emails to your contacts you can take advantage of Mautic to do the same thing. Later, as you have time you an begin to implement other Mautic-features into your business flow.

Here is a short 3 step guide for creating an email marketing campaign with Mautic.



### Step 1: Create Your List

Just as when you are working with an email marketing client you need to define a list of the leads you want to interact with. This could be a list of customers or a list of leads. You can enter these email addresses manually or you can mass-import them easily from a CSV file. (This means you can export them from your existing system and import them directly into Mautic.) Creating this list allows you to quickly filter and group your leads for use in your campaigns later.

### Step 2: Create Your Emails

The second step is the central piece of this guide. You have to write your emails. This takes a bit of time and you should think carefully about the content and structure of each email. Remember that you will be sending these over a time period and your leads will be receiving them gradually. Make sure the content flows smoothly from one email to the next and provide plenty of opportunities for quick review of previous content. Also, be sure to follow standard best practices for every detail of your email. You want to ensure a maximum number of reads, opens, and click-throughs. You can do this by following some basic principles of good email marketing. We’ll review these principles in another blog post.

### Step 3: Define Your Basic Campaign

The final step in the process of using Mautic for email marketing involves [creating a basic campaign](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/drip-marketing-campaign/). Before you panic thinking this campaign process will be too much to understand realize that we will only be creating the most basic of workflows. That’s right for an email marketing campaign like we are defining you simply need to add emails to the campaign builder and define a time delay before sending the next email. Nothing else. We’re not talking about any fancy drip-flow campaigns, decision trees, or anything complex. We’re simply organizing a timeline for emails to be sent.

Implementing these three steps will allow you to immediately begin using Mautic to handle all of your email marketing as you would do with other software. Over time as you become more familiar with the various other aspects of Mautic you will be able to expand on this foundation to a more robust marketing system. This is the beauty of Mautic. This is power in simplicity. When you are ready to do more, Mautic is ready to help.
