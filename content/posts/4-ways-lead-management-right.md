### Transcript

These are the four roads that will lead to a better sales funnel. Not a comprehensive sales lead model but should get you started in the **right** direction.


	2. 

#### The Right Technology



	   - **Know Your Needs**: Before you can select the right technology you need to fully understand the problems you want this technology to solve.
	   - **Prepare to Scale**: Donâ€™t select the marketing software you will use based on your current situation. You expect to be successful; plan for the future.
	   - **Identify Your Costs**: What you spend on the right technology is an investment in your future; identify what you will spend implementing marketing tech.



	4. 

#### The Right Beginning



	   - **Sales Team**: Sales teams and marketing teams must work together to create the best strategy for customer growth.
	   - **Marketing**: Marketing begins when your business begins. There is no such thing as too early to begin marketing.
	   - **Audience**: The identified target audience dictates a sales and marketing focus from the very beginning.



	6. 

#### The Right Campaigns



	   - **Timing**: Campaigns need to be bold in sharing the right information at the right times with your leads.
	   - **Repetition**: Campaigns should always have a clear and distinct purpose or goal to be accomplished.
	   - **Purpose**: Campaigns should be organized to execute at the ideal times.



	8. 

#### The Right Reporting



	   - **Lead Tracking**: Right reporting focuses on lead activity: such as time spent on page, pages visited, and social sharing.
	   - **Engagements**: Reporting should include engagement activity between company and lead.
	   - **Conversions**: Right reporting identifies which pages and forms provide the best conversions.
