Now that we’ve announced a Release Candidate for Mautic 1.0.0 after four, yes four, beta versions, we wanted to show you **some of our progress** since the last release. In the past few weeks we have seen everything come together beautifully and we couldn’t be more excited to have built something the world wants; a solution to marketing inequality.  

    For months we have repeatedly ripped Mautic apart and put it back together again so that you could have a complete and powerful marketing automation solution. We are redefining the image of open source software by giving you a program that isn’t just powerful in its functionality, but beautiful by design.  

 Here’s what it looks like to have polished the rough edges from a developmental perspective.
