### Drupal and Mautic Together!

Drupal is a world-class content management system used by governments ([whitehouse.gov](https://whitehouse.gov)), schools ([harvard.edu](http://harvard.edu)), business ([weather.com](http://weather.com)) and even other open source projects ([redhat.com](http://redhat.com) & [opensource.com](http://opensource.com))!  So of course, Mautic integrates with every major version of Drupal.
