At Mautic, we want to help you **build meaningful relationships**.  This can be with potential customers, constituents or even business partners.

We do this by providing you with the tools to reach them. These include among other things **forms, landing pages, assets, emails, text messages and web notifications**.  Once all these are ready, you can incorporate them into simple or complex **campaigns**.

As people flow through campaigns, you can segment them into more refined groups, create follow up points of contact and more!

Finally, the best campaigns are properly **evaluated** campaigns!  Mautic gives you a drag and drop dashboard and reports to help you track everything.

### We call this the "PACE" workflow.
People->Assets->Campaigns->Evaluate.
