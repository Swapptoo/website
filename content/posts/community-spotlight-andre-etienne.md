We love finding and featuring amazing community members who are doing incredible things for Mautic.  

   


#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

I have been into web development, digital marketing and graphic design for 15 years, when I started my own creative studio I always researched different systems to utilise for clients and make business easier for all. My main focus has always been helping start-ups get off the ground digitally and with their marketing/literature. Eventually after years I stumbled upon Mautic via Softaculous, started using it, have praised it since and have seen how it has evolved massively.


#### What is one word that describes you?

That’s a hard one, I’d say...insistent.


#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic and what is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

When I started using Mautic I had so many ideas on ways to expand the system for CRM use, task management and for client use. Once I found the Mautic Slack community I was able to speak to many of the contributors and the people that basically helped me lay a foundation for all the start-up businesses I’ve worked with over the years; so as much as I wanted to expand Mautic there is no place better to do so than the slack community by contributing.

The best part of the community is how open and fast it is to learn from many different people, great place to converse and good networking.


#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

“Daddy, you’re a superhero.” — my son Isaac :)


#### What is your BAG (big, audacious goal) in life?

My BHAG is to continuously build and adapt a community that is suitable for all people and company sizes to utilise and aid their business in all digital aspects. Most people stumble upon “new tech/software” they could use from different sites but do not have the support to help them grow in its use or purpose. I’m in the process of this by building a company called Your Digital Club.


#### What do you enjoy doing when you’re not working?

I’m a family man so when I’m not working I’m spending time with my wife and son, the latest craze with my son is pirates and making me “walk the plank” with his form sword in hand.


#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

I’ve watched all the twilight movies (not by choice :( ) lol


### Dear Andre,

The Mautic community would like to recognize your incredible dedication and support, and offer a huge, heartfelt, thank you! You’re awesome, and we appreciate everything you do to make Mautic the same.
