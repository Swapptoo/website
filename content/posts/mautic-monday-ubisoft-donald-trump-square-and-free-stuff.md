This week in our Mautic Monday marketing news we have a wide range of interesting topics. In case this is your first week to join us: we take some time on Monday to look back on recent headlines related to marketing and maybe pick up a tip or two based on what others are doing right (or wrong).

We start this week with a reminder that honest and transparent marketing is always the best way to build a strong brand and consumer loyalty. Recently Ubisoft failed to do this and as a result are struggling with a bit of a PR nightmare.

### Square says its super-simple email marketing tools are paying off for small businesses

Six months after introducing square marketing, the company has data that shows its digital coupons increase sales. If you pay attention to news coming from Square, you know that it's been a long time since all it did was process credit-card payments using its itty-bitty swiper.

In May 2014, it turned receipts into miniature customer surveys and started fronting money to small businesses that they could repay a little bit at a time from their Square transactions.
