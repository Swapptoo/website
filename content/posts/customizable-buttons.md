If you've used Mautic at all, you know you can build some great landing pages and emails using the drag and drop editor. The editor went underwent a great revision in Mautic 2.5 ([watch a video](https://www.mautic.org/blog/developer/mautic-2-5-open-sesame/)) and with it came the ability to **create html buttons instead of relying on the button widget**.

Now, there's nothing wrong with the button widget. It's actually quite easy to use!  You simply click on the button icon, drag it to where you need a button and release.


### Sometimes you just need more...


If you know a little html and css, you can now easily create your own html based buttons right in the editor and have complete control over how they appear in the page or email.
