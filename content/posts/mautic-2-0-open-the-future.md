One of the most powerful ways to engage people is through a story. A couple of weeks ago members of the Mautic team spent time discovering the story we’re all writing. What we determined is that it’s a story of open. Providing immense capability in the form of an open connection to community. Empowering individuals, businesses and enterprises alike with open access to powerful communication tools. We've heard so many of you share your excitement of finding a solution that enables you to share the powerful story of your organization with a receptive audience. To more deeply understand the needs of your customers and bring them value. 

We're thrilled to continue writing this story of open with you. Equipping you with more tools to share your stories in a meaningful and compelling way. The features in Mautic 2.0 will change the way you market. They will begin to help you connect systems in your business, ultimately creating memorable customer experiences at each and every lifecycle stage.

We can’t wait to see how you use these features! We’d encourage you to visit the [Community Forum](https://www.mautic.org/community), [Slack](https://www.mautic.org/slack), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/trymautic), [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/mautic) and other channels to share all the incredible things you’re doing with Mautic.

### **Javascript Chart Update**

Reports in Mautic have always been fully customizable. But what do you do when you want to compare elements of a single campaign over time? This state of the art dashboard feature will enable intuitive analysis of campaign performance by highlighting/selecting specific metrics to load into dashboard.  






**


### **New Email and Landing Page Builder**

Our WSYIWIG editor has been getting accolades since the moment we launched Mautic. But when we set our sights on better usability, good things happen. We invite you to check out the brand new email and landing page editor. Now there is more creative and developer control than ever before. We can’t wait to see what you develop while using these tools. For a closer look at theme development, [click here](https://www.mautic.org/blog/developer/theme-development-in-mautic-2-0/).

### **Code Re-Factoring Part 1**

Not only are features important to 2.0, but so is performance. We believe that time is an incredibly valuable resource. So we have focused our efforts on making Mautic faster and more reliable. Use your time more effectively, engaging your customers. Part 1 is complete, but it’s just the tip of the iceberg.  






**


### **UTM Tags**

One of the most powerful aspects of marketing automation is segmentation. When you can specify certain types of communication to go to very specific segments, engagement happens. Now with UTM (Urchin Tracking Module), you can gain greater insight by tracking, monitoring and segmenting your traffic and contacts.  






**


### **The Lifecycle Dashboard**

Segmentation is clearly an extremely powerful tool. However, it does not do a good job tracking the progression of contacts through the buying journey. We’d like to introduce the Lifecycle Dashboard. Track and trigger updates based on lifecycle stages for contacts. Use a new dashboard to analyze what stages contacts in various segments are at.  






**


### **Campaign Attribution Reports**

Return on Investment. As a marketer this acronym is often the cornerstone of your marketing efforts. With a whole new set of reports, you can now measure campaign success based on first touch, last touch or multi touch attribution. With this level of reporting, you business can track each individual interaction across the entire customer lifecycle attributing revenue goals to your marketing campaigns.  






**


### **Bi-Directional Salesforce Integration**

You’ve spoken, and we’re listening. Introducing the bi-directional sync between Salesforce and Mautic. You can now trigger more relevant communications based on data tracked in Salesforce. This is the first of many steps toward developing a more robust and open marketing stack for your business.  





And that one more thing we referenced?


**


### **Dynamic Content**

That's right. One of the most requested features we’ve received to date is here. You can now send dynamic content as part of your campaign activity. Not only that, but you can also measure it’s effectiveness. Providing dynamic content is one of the most powerful ways you can engage your audience and provide a customized user experience.
