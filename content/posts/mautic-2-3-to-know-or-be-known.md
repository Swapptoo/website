As marketers, we live in an interesting time. Data collection is at an all time high and AI tools are growing at incredibly rapid pace.  And although 80% of consumers trust businesses with their personal information, it increasingly comes at a high cost. 


> For all industries and business segments that want to use personal data to enhance their own customer experiences, it’s important to remember that customers are willing to share their information if they know you are using it to help them get what they want...

The responsibility is on us, as organizations to provide value with the exchange of data. We must assure our customers that we not only see them, but we know *about* them; and there is a significant difference. It’s critical that we seek to understand their specific needs  at every step of the buying journey, from desktop to mobile and everywhere in between.


> No matter what innovations businesses set in front of consumers, and no matter how they try to serve them, customer expectations will accelerate. ([Source](http://www.forbes.com/sites/marymeehan/2015/08/12/customer-expectation-trends-they-want-it-all-so-get-out-of-the-way/#573b68204a9f))


In the latest release, you will not only have access to more powerful information, but you can create a more connected, value-driven experience.  From integrations to more effective communication tools, you will be able to know more about your audience, not simply know them.


### Integrations:
 


- **Workflow Integrations:** There are 4 new plugins to integrate data from Citrix into Mautic. These include GoToMeeting, GoToWebinar, GoToAssist and GoToTraining. You can now automatically create contacts in Mautic when individuals register for your events in the Citrix tools from form data in Mautic. In addition, you can pull registrant and attendee data back from the Citrix tools into Mautic and trigger campaigns based on this information. The registration and attendance data is also stored as part of the contact’s timeline in Mautic, giving you more information at a glance.

- **Data Enhancement:** Data enhancement tools like FullContact and ClearBit can now be integrated with Mautic. Users of these services can enhance their contact and company data in Mautic by clicking buttons on the contact (or company) and bringing data in from those services. 

- **Accounts Integration:** Data from Salesforce Accounts can now be synched with Companies in Mautic. In addition we have optimized the API to minimize the number of API calls Mautic makes. Data from a new field type – formula fields – is also now available for mapping data between Salesforce and Mautic. Lastly Salesforce users can now access the timeline for the contact in Mautic by clicking on a link on the page in Salesforce. 



### Campaign Management:



- **Preference Center:** You can now collect preferences for your contacts in Mautic including  preferred channels, categories, timings and segments. This will help you manage delivery of more relevant messages, using channels the contact prefers. 

- **Account Based Marketing Update: **We have added a number of new features to Account Based Marketing. Companies in Mautic can now be merged; you now easily change the primary company on a contact; and you can apply a lead score at the company level. These features are in addition to a new set of reports that are available to measure performance at the company level.

- **Global Categories:** You can specify global categories across emails, landing pages, stages etc to categorize groups of entities in Mautic. You no longer need to define categories individually for each entity in Mautic, helping you stay organized and save you time.

- **Email/Landing Page Builder:** We've created an all new view for those who want to go under the hood and adjust HTML when developing emails and landing pages. The Content tab has been replaced with the new Code Mode view. This view will provide users with 2 panes in the Builder, one to edit the HTML directly and another to preview. Simply select Code Mode to start building, or to convert your existing communications into this view.



Each of these enhancements is another step toward smarter marketing. But with these tools come a greater responsibility to not only know our audience, but know their preferences and their needs as well.
