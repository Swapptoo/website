We are excited to announce that today we are unveiling our brand-new Mautic Developer Hub.  


This is the beginning for what we anticipate to be one of our greatest resources for developers working with marketing automation and Mautic, specifically the Mautic SDK. This is for all you looking to hack together something amazing and use Mautic in your setup. We've got real-life examples, code snippets, a full marketing automation API for Mautic and tons of other resources packed in here to help you.  


Our Mautic SDK gives you the opportunity to integrate anything with your marketing automation. With our Mautic SDK you can use a REST API to integrate all the things. Doesn't matter what language or codebase your other systems are written in, or even what language you know - with a beautiful and detailed REST API you can interact easily with Mautic.  


And this is just the beginning of what we want to offer in our **Mautic Developer Hub**. We think it's a pretty great start but we're not done. Keep an eye on this space as we continue to add features and goodies specifically relevant for developers. We know how hard you work to make the rest of the company look good! Here's some Mautic awesomeness just for you.
