One of the great features of **standalone** forms in Mautic is the ability to perform **actions** when someone submits the form.



### [![form actions on standalone forms](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/form-actions1.jpg)
](https://www.mautic.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/form-actions1.jpg)Using standalone forms, you can do the following at the time of submission:



	- Adjust a contact's points
	- Modify a contact's segment
	- Modify a contact's tags
	- Provide an asset to download
	- Push the contact to an integration (like a CRM)
	- Send an email to the contact
	- Send an email to any user
	- Send the form results to anyone


**It is important to note that if you use this type of form, you must send the contact to a segment to include them in a campaign later on.**

Adding actions to a form is really helpful.  In this Mautic Minute video, we demonstrate five actions, all triggered by a single form submission.  You could create a form that uses all the actions or just one.  It's that powerful.
