One of the reasons you decided to use Mautic was to build better relationships with the people that come your way.  Sending blanket, boring, cookie cutter emails kind of defeats that purpose!

Instead of an email addressed to "Hi there!", why not say "Hi Rod" - (probably using **their** first name would be better...).  Mautic makes it easy to personalize your emails, using information from any contact field on their profile.

### Inserting Personalized Information

In any text area, just type the left brace - { - and the first few letters of the field you want to insert.  For instance, "{fir" would bring up the relevant field code for the first name field. If you'd prefer to use the WYSIWYG editor, click on the insert token link.
