### Joomla! and Mautic Together!

Joomla! is the second most popular content management system in the world.  It powers sites such as the [Eiffel Tower](http://www.toureiffel.paris/en.html), the [Guggenheim Museum](http://www.guggenheim.org/), the [United Nations Regional Information Centre](http://www.unric.org/en/) and millions more.  So of course, Mautic integrates with Joomla!



### Installing the Plugin

Its a simple process:


	2. [Download the plugin](https://www.mautic.org/integrations/joomla/). (Joomla! 2.5x & 3.x)
	4. Install it as you would any other extension (extensions -> manage -> install)
	6. Configure the plugin with your Mautic URL.

Once the plugin is installed and configured, you can embed forms anywhere on your site.  You'll also begin to see contact information populating your leads.
