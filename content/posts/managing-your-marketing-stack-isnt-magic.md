Marketing stack. If you’ve been in marketing technology circles long enough, you’ve heard this term. It refers to all the technologies that your business utilizes to reach and engage your customers. Which by all accounts continues to grow. There are over 5,000 solutions that fall into the marketing technology ecosystem. So many, that to look at [chiefmartec’s MarTech 5000 infographic](https://martechtoday.com/infographic-marketing-technology-landscape-113956), would make one lose their balance.

This poses a serious challenge for us in the marketing space. And it’s being realized across the entire industry.

> “A Q1 ‘17 survey by [CMO Council](https://www.cmocouncil.org/) and [Redpoint Global](https://www.redpointglobal.com/) revealed only 3% of respondents felt all of their automation, engagement and deployment tools were fully connected, with data, metrics and insights traveling freely between different technologies.” ([Source](https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/11/organizing-your-marketing-tech-stack/))

It’s an alarming statistic, but not surprising. With so many solutions, there is an incredible opportunity to be more thoughtful in our approach to the design, organization, and management of our marketing stack. Let’s look at a few realities that will move us from not-so-managed to managed-magic.
**Open Strategy:** What does your marketing technology strategy look like? Is it focused on doing whatever is necessary to delight the customer? Or is it limited by what your technology allows it to do? If your strategy is not open to allow you to take unique and innovative approaches to connecting with your customer, then you should reconsider your approach.  


**Narrow Focus:** With over 5,000 technology solutions it can feel like a daunting task to take an open strategy then narrow your focus. But this focus is not where you think it might be. The focus should be on your customers and associates. Clearly defining your marketing strategy with an open architecture, will allow your teams to take ownership of their place in the customer journey. This enables them to be hyper-focused on improving their processes and workflows and bringing value at each stage.  


**Manage Many:** Regardless of the size of your business, effectively managing multiple technologies can warrant additional time and/or resources. With literally thousands of technologies to help organizations execute on their marketing strategy, it will require proper management to effectively deliver your brand message and promise.  


Every business is at a different stage of marketing stack development. Some have had solutions for years and are currently reviewing how each improves their customer journey. Others are flexible enough to make changes to their stack to prepare it for the future of open marketing. Organizations that are successful will be able to address each of these realities in a way that meets the needs of the business and creates a meaningful brand experience.
