We love finding and featuring our amazing community members who are doing amazing things for Mautic.  

   


#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

I am CTO of Facet Interactive and we have been building a team around delivering marketing intelligence services. For the past 8 years I've been working with Drupal, and more recently have started working with some clients in marketing automation and marketing strategy role. As we got up to speed on marketing automation, being from the Drupal world I started looking for something similarly Open Source, and was happy to find Mautic.org.


#### What is one word that describes you?

Hungry


#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic and what is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

I started by joining the Mautic Slack (now Discord), and simply wanted to learn as much as I could. After getting a feel for the community after a few weeks, whenever I felt like I had even a rough idea about a potential solution—I'd share it. I'm always interested in solving the problem by introducing a specific use case or methodology. I've noticed that often times, you can get stuck trying to use an application in a specific way _that you expect to "just work" based on previous experience_, but often times we have to challenge these preconceptions.


#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

"I want to be like you when I grow up." —someone older than me


#### What is your BAG (big, audacious goal) in life?

My BHAG is to figure out how to model value intuitively for business owners. We're very much focused on communicating value to our clients in ways that matter to them, using language that they prefer—rather than language we prefer. The problem is very interesting to me, and I am passionate about driving these conversations here at Facet.


#### What do you enjoy doing when you're not working?

I have a few vices which keep me busy: coffee, mezcal, tequila, wine, cooking (learning), and I enjoy spending time in our garden tending my wild bonsai and succulents. "Epic Fantasy" novels are my jam, too.


#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

That I garden. Ha!


### Dear Jordan,

The Mautic community would like to recognize your incredible dedication and support, and offer a huge, heartfelt, thank you! You’re awesome, and we appreciate everything you do to make Mautic the same.
