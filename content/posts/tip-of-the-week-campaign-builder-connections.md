Each week we're going to try and share a tip related to Mautic you might find helpful! We'll make them short and sweet **and helpful**.  

    This week we are sharing a quick tip related to the campaign builder and creating campaign workflows. It might be a simple tip for some but when creating your campaign it can be highly useful.   

 
> **Tip:** Campaign actions and decisions don't have to be connected to work. Actions can be triggered on a delay and without being directly connected to other actions or decisions.
