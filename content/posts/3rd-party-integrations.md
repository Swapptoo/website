Everyone likes to use new software, but at the same time everyone likes to keep using what’s familiar. It’s a difficult thing to learn new programs and although it’s fun to play with something different it’s often not enough to simply be pretty to look at. The software needs to improve workflow or business productivity and be intuitive to use. These concepts make the software easy to use and quick to pick up but it doesn’t make it something which will endure. There’s another important factor which will determine whether the software sticks around.  

    
### Integrations
 If the new software integrates with existing systems then you’re more likely to continue using it. Integrations are critical to the success of a new piece of software. Mautic understands this importance and we’ve worked a ridiculous number of hours making sure we can integrate with dozens of other software systems immediately. And we’re adding more constantly.  

 We’ve been busy setting up integrations with Joomla, WordPress, Drupal, Typo3, Concrete5, Salesforce, MailChimp, SendGrid, Mandrill, Microsoft Dynamics, SugarCRM, vTiger, Cobalt, and many many more. Seriously, the list is exhausting!  

 
### Community
 The truth is simple -because Mautic is community-driven our volunteers are the true power to help create new integrations. We want to make Mautic the most integrated and supportive system available. Our community helps us to do things that other marketing automation systems can only dream about.
