It is an exciting time for everyone involved with Mautic. We take pride in the software we have produced and we know it’s something the world needs, something powerful, something beautiful and completely open source. [ Mautic 1.0 Stable Release](/blog/introducing-mautic-1-0) is jam packed with features and integrations that you requested and helped develop. We are so very thankful to all of volunteers, and at times like this we celebrate how far we’ve come and look toward the future.  

        

 We want you to be a part of our future, and to be a part of yours. Join us in planning for the development of Mautic as we discuss the **product roadmap**. Many of our community members are **open source development experts** and we would love for you to weigh in on the conversation.
