The process of learning new software and frameworks is not always easy, but it certainly makes things better when you have some help. That is exactly why Mautic Founder, David Hurley, will be giving another 'Hands on' webinar.  




 

Next week's webinar you learn the details and features of the software as you get 'Hands on With Forms & Landing pages Both of these topics are vital assets of a successful campaign. So mark your calendars and get ready  to learn all about the powerful features that make Mautic unique (in addition to being open source that is).
