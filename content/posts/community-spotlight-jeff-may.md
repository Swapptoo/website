#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

So my background is that I am a young entrepreneur and I own my company that I bootstrapped. I wanted the challenge of creating something for myself. I have always run a little against the grain and I guess starting an business  was a bit of an expectation I placed on myself from a young age. There are challenges with everything in life, if there aren’t then it is probably not worth doing. Right now I am essentially a sole proprietor but do have a few independent contractors.  I am working with businesses that are stuck in the past and cash strapped. That means expectations are exceptionally high and margins are small, which makes for a difficult place to run a business when you are still learning the basics. However, the reward is that I get to build something that is different and that really hasn’t been seen before, and when companies finally do start working with me I get to see the tangible benefits to their business - that gives me a rush. I am really glad I found Mautic to help me minimize costs as it helps address the “cash strapped” issue with many of my clients. I learned about Mautic through Google and a couple friends who thought I might like the project. 


#### What is one word that describes you?

Inquisitive  


#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic and what is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

I decided to get involved with Mautic because I think it is a great tool and the idea of open sourced marketing automation just makes sense. The control over data and flexibility that Mautic offers was the largest draw for me. (Though, I would be lying if the cost savings over other tools wasn’t a draw.) I really like that the Mautic community is focusing on similar projects professionally.


#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

That I am go getter with a strong sense of reason and morality. 


#### What is your BAG (big, audacious goal) in life?

To be surrounded by people who matter and to not have the day to day stress most people feel in a capitalist society. 


#### What do you enjoy doing when you’re not working?

I love to be outdoors: skiing, biking, hiking, and I really enjoy cooking


#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

I think most people are surprised that I can be emotional.
