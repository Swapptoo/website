We love finding and featuring our amazing community members who are doing amazing things for Mautic.  

   


#### What is your professional background and how did you come to learn about Mautic?

I’m a PHP developer, and my specialty is CMS. I’m one of the core contributor of concrete5 open source CMS. My job is supporting enterprises who want to improve their digital marketing on the web. Recently, more and more marketing departments understand the importance of data driven marketing. So, I've been looking for Marketing Automation which can be easily integrated to other systems. Then, I found Mautic!


#### What is one word that describes you?

Creative


#### Why did you decide to become involved with Mautic?

The first reason, Mautic is an open source. I like the community and philosophy of Mautic. The second, this innovative free marketing automation is not yet popular in Japan. I believe enhancing the community appearance can make a difference. This is why I started local [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Mautic-Meetup-Tokyo/) in Tokyo.


#### What is the most wonderful compliment anyone has ever given you?

Release notes of lovely software :-)


#### What kind of work are you doing with Mautic these days?

Help people who want to know about marketing automation.


#### What is your BAG (big audacious goal) in life?

Democratize the world of digital marketing.


#### What is your favorite part about the Mautic community?

In Japan, our community has just begun, but we already have many emotional and creative community members. It's not just me. This is most exciting thing of the community.


#### What is one thing that may surprise people about you?

My first programming language is not about web development. It’s SuperCollider for algorithmic music composition! Yes, I'm a also a computer musician.

It is also an open source project, and I started Japanese community of this language in 2006 when I was a college student. Maybe I'm an addict of open source programming and community ;-)
