It is our great pleasure to announce the release of [Mautic 1.0.0 Public Beta](/download)!  


We are proud of what we have created in our product and we believe you should take pride in your participation. Our community is the uniquely powerful factor that makes this project so exciting and you are the ones to thank!



### New Beta Users

If this is your first introduction to Mautic then we welcome you! You are about to experience the very best in marketing automation. You have two ways to take advantage of Mautic. You can [download](/download) directly from the Mautic website. Use this method if you want to host your own marketing automation platform (that's right, no more SaaS for you!). The second option is to register for an account on [Mautic.com](https://mautic.com) where you can be up and running in less than 3 minutes. This account is free and never expires!

### Existing Beta Users

For those who already have a [mautic.com](https://www.mautic.com) hosted account, no action is required as we have already upgraded your accounts.

For those who have set up their own installations of Mautic, there are a couple of update options available to you:


	- **Option 1 (Preferred):** Use the command line updater
	- **Option 2:** Update with FTP


You can find all the details and update procedures [in the community forum](/community/index.php/35-beta-3-released)
