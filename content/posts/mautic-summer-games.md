Mautic is an incredible international community. And each member has unique value. There are meetup organizers, developers, users and translators from all over the globe. Every single person has made an incredible contribution to bring Mautic to where it is today. We wanted to continue to celebrate that contribution by hosting our very own Mautic Summer Games! 

As training for the Rio Olympics  gets underway, we see the immense work that is done by these athletes in preparation for the games. In a similar manner, each of us works hard to compete in today’s business world. We plan, organize, implement and deploy new ideas. Although our environment may not be an open stadium, it is certainly an open marketplace. And unlike the real Olympics where only a single person is rewarded with a medal, everyone wins when you contribute to an open source project like Mautic.  


## Who can participate?
 
According to Olympic records, Cecilia Colledge was the youngest female competitor in the Olympics. She was only 11YO.  The oldest to ever compete? Arthur von Pongracz of Austria, who was 72. We'd like to approach the Mautic Summer Games in a same manner. We believe everyone has worth and value. That you can contribute and participate to this community in some way shape or form. So we're excited to open up the competition to developers/creators/designers of all ages.  


## What are the events?
 
In preparation for the Mautic Summer Games we wanted to give you a rundown of all the different events that we will be offering. Regardless of your skill level or expertise, everyone should be able to participate.
