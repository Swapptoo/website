One of the fundamental beliefs we hold in the Mautic community is the power of personal communication. We believe [automated marketing](https://www.mautic.org/marketing-automation-software/) can still be personal.  


There is a multitude of evidence pointing to the increased effectiveness of sending personal emails versus a corporate newsletter type of email. But just because you’re sending a personal email does not mean that you have to personally write the email each time. There are plenty of times when you find yourself sending almost the identical email multiple times to different individuals. When you find yourself in one of these situations you should stop and think - is there a better way. The answer is yes. Mautic gives you the power of sending automated (and personal) email messages.



So what does a personal email look like? We’re glad you asked. There used to be the idea that just using a name in the salutation line would be enough to consider your email “personal”. But we believe it’s much more than just how you address someone. Being personal is a number of things and a "Dear John" is only the beginning, in more ways than one.

**Personal emails mean they come from you and not your business.** This means you should send email not from a generic corporate or organization email address but from a personal address. This is important for several reasons. First, if you send from a personal email address your recipients are far more likely to open your email because it feels like a personal message from you to them. Second, many times your personal address will have an avatar associated with it that will cause your leads to recognize your face in their inbox.

**Personal emails are more unique than just the beginning.** This means customizations and personalizations should occur throughout the email. Lead fields, product specific information and other unique aspects of each lead should be used throughout the email. Admittedly this is a bit of a fine line as you don’t want to pretend there is a strong relationship with a potential lead when they don’t believe there is. And you certainly don’t want to compromise a potentially good relationship by appearing to impersonal. This takes time and practice.

**Personal emails look personal and not like a corporate newsletter. ** Don’t send emails meant to engage users that look like they are a standard HTML newsletter meant to simply share the latest sales and special offers. You know exactly the type of email we’re talking about. There is certainly a time and a place to send newsletters to your users. Mautic can easily handle sending these types of emails, but when we’re talking about personal emails we are specifically focusing on sending emails to engage leads and lead to further conversations.
