### Welcome to the Mautic Minute!

This is the first in what we hope will be a long list of short tutorials on different aspects of Mautic.  Today's tutorial answers a question I received from a user last week.

There are two kinds of forms:  "Campaign" and "Standalone", each with its own characteristics.  How do I know which one to use?

### Choosing the Right Form

Campaign forms allow you to send people straight into a campaign and be the source for that campaign.  These can be edited even after a campaign has begun. Any actions you might want to perform at the time of submission, are handled by the campaign itself, and that can be limiting.

Standalone forms can also allow you to kick-off a campaign. The main difference is that the form submitter must be added to a list as one of the form actions.  The form itself cannot be used as a campaign lead.  You can perform any number of actions on a standalone form!  For instance, if you want an email sent to an administrator when the form submits, then you would use the standalone variety.

**Campaign Forms:**


	- Push the lead directly into a campaign.
	- Can not perform other actions outside of the campaign workflow.


**Standalone Forms:**


	- Can not initiate a campaign.
	- Can perform actions at submission such as:


	   - adjust a lead's points
	   - modify lead's lists (which must be done if this form starts a campaign)
	   - modify lead's tags
	   - download an asset
	   - push lead to integration
	   - send email to lead
	   - send email to user
	   - send form results (such as another administrator)
