This week in our Mautic Monday marketing news we are focusing on three quick articles you'll find interesting. Each has a different focus but each has something uniquely special that makes it worth your time to read.

### Straight Outta Compton

"It seems as if there has been a new must-read piece about [N.W.A.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N.W.A), [Straight Outta Compton](http://www.straightouttacompton.com/) or gangsta rap every single day for the last few months. The release of F Gary Gray’s flick on group has served as the hook for so many people to relive the halycon days of old and there have been many fine pieces of work as a result.

But Straight Outta Compton is one of times when the marketing folks managed to work every single angle for the best possible result. Be it the way in which [that iconic poster was pimped out](http://www.straightouttasomewhere.com/) or even the way in which a lot of the narrative around the Dre album was all about the film, Straight Outta Compton’s sales pitch could not have been better scripted. It helps, of course, that there was a lot of articles waiting to be written about that era and the film presented the perfect excuse."

### Beyond Email: **Use Multi-channel marketing automation to generate and nurture leads**

"While marketing automation is a hot topic across industries, many marketers are daunted by the complexities of combining customer journeys, content strategies, and dense technologies. Marketing automation technology allows marketers to generate and nurture leads with sequenced, segmented, and automated campaigns that deliver content at scale, with minimal intervention. Automation can be used to dynamically change content; test messaging; and sequence messages and notifications. As with any marketing initiative, the goal should always be focused on providing content that benefits your customers."
**Top ways mentioned in this article include: email, websites, social media, and mobile.**

### Why you can’t get buy-in for your great marketing ideas

"It’s not entirely their fault, though. Unfortunately, many marketers are restricted by their boss’s reluctance to invest in new ideas and approaches to marketing. Why spend thousands of dollars to fix what isn’t broken? It doesn’t matter that a new approach could reach an entirely new audience, or help you reach your existing customers more effectively. Stepping out of the marketing comfort zone when the bottom line is at stake is scary."


	- You focus on tactics not results
	- You don’t highlight the competition
	- You don’t pay attention to cost
	- You don’t set reasonable expectations
