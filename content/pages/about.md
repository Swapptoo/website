# Mautic & Open Source Marketing Automation


Mautic began with a single focus. Equality. The Mautic community believes in giving every person the power to understand, manage, and grow their business or organization. Mautic is focused on helping this belief become a reality by getting powerful marketing automation software into the hands of everyone.  


When David Hurley (@dbhurley) began Mautic he had a big goal. A plan to **move horizons**, and change the world. He foresaw Mautic as software made by the people and for the people and as such the community became a top priority and integral part. Those people interested in becoming involved in a community with a vision to change the world should consider getting involved in Mautic. People are the priority. Equality is the goal.
